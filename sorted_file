('bat','civet')|15 for group b betacovs , sarsr-cov is believed to be transmitted from civet to humans , although it is the horseshoe bat that was likely the primary host .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3630921/pdf/|after the sars epidemic, we started to focus on cov biodiversity, genomics and phylogeny and built up an evolutionary map of cov evolution. before 2003, there were less than 10 covs with complete genomes available, which include two human covs, human coronavirus 229e (hcov-229e) and human coronavirus oc43 (hcov-oc43). by september 2012, the number of covs with complete genomes sequenced had tripled. it includes two additional human covs, human coronavirus nl63 (hcov-nl63) and human coronavirus hku1 (hcov-hku1). 2,3 traditionally, covs were classified into groups 1, 2 and 3. in 2011, the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses has re-classified these three groups of covs as three genera, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus; and we have discovered a fourth genus of cov, deltacoronavirus, which includes at least nine avian covs and a porcine coronavirus hku15. 4, 5 within the betacovs, they are further subclassified into group a, including hcov-hku1, hcov-oc43, bovine coronavirus (bcov), sable antelope coronavirus, giraffe coronavirus, equine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, murine hepatitis virus, rat coronavirus and rabbit coronavirus hku14 (rbcov hku14); 6 group b, including the human and civet sars-related covs (sarsr-cov) and sars-related rhinolophus bat coronavirus (sarsr-rh-batcov); 7,8 group c, including tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 (ty-batcov hku4) and pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 (pi-batcov hku5) we discovered in 2006; 9,10 and group d, including rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 (ro-batcov hku9). 10, 11 in addition to ty-batcov hku4 and pi-batcov hku5, other group c bat betacovs should also be present, but their complete genome sequences are not available. 12, 13 based on the covs discovered, we have constructed a model of cov evolution, with evidence supporting that bat covs are the gene source of alphacovs and betacovs and avian covs are the gene source of gammacovs and deltacovs. 5 all these works have laid down an evolutionary map for rapid phylogenetic and bioinformatics analyses of hcov-emc. the diversity of covs is a result t of the infidelity of rdrp which make cov genomes especially plastic, a high frequency of homologous rna recombination due to their unique random template switching during rna replication, and their large genomes. in addition to biodiversity, a number of natural recombination and possible interspecies jumping events has also been documented in betacovs. 6, 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] for group a betacovs, molecular clock analysis has shown that hcov-oc43 is a relatively recent zoonotic virus of bovine origin that emerged in around 1890 likely from bovine-to-human transmission. 17 we have also recently discovered rbcov hku14, closely related to other members of the species betacoronavirus 1 including hcov-oc43 and bcov, with recombination events that may have played a role in interspecies transmission of these hcov-oc43related viruses between human, cattle, rabbits, swine and horses. 6 despite having circulated in humans for more than a century, hcov-oc43 is also found to be continuously evolving, with the recent emergence of a novel genotype due to natural recombination. 15 for group b betacovs, sarsr-cov is believed to be transmitted from civet to humans, although it is the horseshoe bat that was likely the primary host. 7, 8 civet sarsr-cov was also likely a recombinant virus arising from different strains of sarsr-rh-batcov from different geographical locations in china. 14, 16 although no interspecies transmission events have been documented in group d betacovs, we have also identified recombination events between different ro-batcov hku9 strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. 11 while these findings supported that betacovs have the propensity to recombine and cause interspecies transmission, such events were unknown in group c betacovs. as hcov-emc is most closely related to ty-batcov hku4 and pi-batcov hku5, it would be important to study their genetic relatedness, which may provide clues on whether bats are the possible origin as in sarsr-cov.
('bat','civet')|for example , previous sars research reported that the interspecies transfer of sarslike coronaviruses from bats to the amplifying host ( e.g. , civet ) occurred in 1998 and that interspecies transfer from civet to humans occurred in 2002 ( chinese , 2004 ; hon et al. , 2008 ; lau et al. , 2010 ; song et al. , 2005 ) .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.04.031|a newly enteric coronavirus, pdcov, was identified in the usa in 2014, and this coronavirus caused clinical signs in swine similar to those of pedv (wang et al., 2014a) . in this study, a novel peav (peav-gd-ch/2017) strain was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea, and this strain shares high identities with the other two peav strains that were previously reported (gong et al., 2017; pan et al., 2017) . these novel peavs are most identical to bat-hku2, with 95% nucleotide identity, and have the same genome organization and trs motif for each orf. the greatest difference between peav and bat-hku2 is their s proteins, which share 85% amino acid identity each other, a value much lower compared with those of other proteins (table 1) . this difference is caused by amino acid mutations in the s protein, particularly in the ntd in the s1 subunit, which has been proven to be the key factor determining issue tropism and the host range of coronaviruses (lu et al., 2015) . in addition to its low amino acid identity with the s protein of hku2-like coronavirus, it shares low amino acid identity (lower than 28%) with s proteins of all known coronaviruses. thus, clarifying the origin of the s proteins of peav and hku2-like coronavirus is important for determining the origin and evolutionary history of these coronaviruses. a previous study showed that the extreme ntd in the s1 subunit of peav is structurally similar to that of nl63, while the rest of the s1 subunit is structurally similar to that of mhv (pan et al., 2017) . in addition, a short peptide in the s protein of bat-hku2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the receptor-binding motif (rbm) in the s1 subunit of sars-cov (lau et al., 2007) . we also analyzed the arginine (position 545) at cleavage sites s1/s2 of peav and found that it is conserved in several beta-covs in this study. moreover, the phylogenetic tree based on the s protein presents a uniform evolutionary relationship; these bat-hku2like coronaviruses cluster with a newly identified rat-cov, lrnv, which represents a novel species of coronaviruses. all of these strains form a distinct lineage and cluster with beta-covs but are separate from all four known subgroups of beta-covs (fig. 3) , which may indicate that these strains are part of a novel subgroup of beta-covs. these results suggest that peav and hku2-like coronaviruses may have some relations with beta-covs and most likely resulted from recombination with the backbone of alpha-cov and the s gene from an unrecognized beta-cov. another large difference between peav and bat-hku2 is n protein, which share about 93.9% amino acid identity, as n protein is a multifunctional protein for coronaviruses, which is involving in virus replication, budding and pathogenesis et al. (mcbride et al., 2014) . while the role of these mutations in n protein between peav and bat-hku2 should further investigate. the origin and emergence time of a newly emerged pathogen are important issues to answer to determine the evolutionary history and plan methods of prevention for these new pathogens. for example, previous sars research reported that the interspecies transfer of sarslike coronaviruses from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civet) occurred in 1998 and that interspecies transfer from civet to humans occurred in 2002 (chinese, 2004; hon et al., 2008; lau et al., 2010; song et al., 2005) . these results provide insight into the origin and evolutionary history of sars coronavirus. the origin and divergence time of other coronaviruses have also been estimated previously; the divergence time of bovine-cov and hcov-oc43 could be dated back to the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and was estimated at 1910 (vijgen et al., 2006) . the tmrca for all pdcov strains was reported at 1991, approximately 24 years before pdcov was identified (woo et al., 2017) . in this study, we also addressed the emergence time and evolutionary history of peav and of the other coronaviruses based on the rdrp gene by bayesian analysis. in anticipation, the mean divergence time of bovine-cov and hcov-oc43 was estimated at 1914, and the mean tmrca of human and civet sarsr-cov was estimated at 2001 in our analysis (fig. 4) . these results are highly consistent with those of a previous report discussed above and further indicate that our analysis is unbiased. the emergence time of peav was estimated at 1926 (95% hpd, 1864 to 1984) based on our analysis, which indicates that peav is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since interspecies transmission from bat to swine occurred. in addition, these hku2-like coronaviruses have a common ancestor with hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e, and the divergence time was estimated at 277, which indicates that these hku2-like coronaviruses have a long evolutionary history. the mean tmrca for alpha-cov, beta-cov, and gamma-cov, as well as those of all coronaviruses estimated in this study, were later compared with those of a previous report (woo et al., 2012) . nevertheless, the mean tmrca coincides with the regions with 95% hpd to each other. the evolutionary rate of different coronaviruses was estimated previously; 4.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year was estimated for hcov-oc43 (vijgen et al., 2005) , and the mean evolutionary rate for group 1b coronaviruses was estimated to be 3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (pyrc et al., 2006) . in addition, the evolutionary rate for all coronaviruses was estimated to be 1.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (woo et al., 2012) , which is estimated to be 1.93 × 10 −4 (95% hpd, 1.27 × 10 −4 to 3.57 × 10 −4 ) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the rdrp gene in this study, and all of these results are comparable to each other.
('bat','civet')|perhaps the most well-known example of viral cross-species transmission involves the sars-cov. studies support a transmission model in which a sars-like cov was transmitted from rhinolophus bats to palm civets , which subsequently transmitted the palm civet-adapted virus to humans at local food markets in southern china .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.08.004|as the ctr of the s 1 subunit contains the protein rbd for most covs, also mutations in this part of s have been associated with changes in the virus' tropism. perhaps the most well-known example of viral cross-species transmission involves the sars-cov. studies support a transmission model in which a sars-like cov was transmitted from rhinolophus bats to palm civets, which subsequently transmitted the palm civet-adapted virus to humans at local food markets in southern china . according to this model, sars-like viruses adapted to both the palm civet and human host, which was reflected in the rapid viral evolution observed for these viruses within these species . two-amino acid substitutions within the rbd were elucidated that are of relevance for binding to the ace2 proteins of palm civets and humans (li et al., 2005b qu et al., 2005) . from these studies it appears that due to strong conservation of ace2 between mammalian species only a few amino acid alterations within the rbd are needed to change coronavirus host species tropism. indeed serial passage of sars-covs in vitro or in vivo can rapidly lead to adaptation to new host species (roberts et al., 2007) . sars-like viruses isolated from bats displayed major differences including a deletion in the ace2 rbm compared to human sars-cov (drexler et al., 2010; ren et al., 2008) and as a consequence were unable of using human ace2 as an entry receptor (becker et al., 2008) . however, recently a novel sarslike btcov was identified, which could use ace2 of rhinolophus bats, palm civets as well as of humans as a functional receptor . these findings not only provide further evidence that bats are indeed the natural reservoir for sars-like covs, but also that these bat coronaviruses can directly include human ace2 in their receptor repertoire. the detection of sequences of sars-cov-like viruses in palm civets and raccoon dogs (guan et al., 2003; tu et al., 2004) therefore probably reflects the unusually wide host range of these viruses. a similar promiscuous receptor usage is also observed for mers-cov which binds to dpp4 of many species (barlan et al., 2014; eckerle et al., 2014; falzarano et al., 2014; m€ uller et al., 2012; van doremalen et al., 2014) as indicated earlier.('bat','civet')|sars-cov and mers-cov are considered highly pathogenic ( cui et al. , 2019 ) , and it is very likely that both sars-cov and mers-cov were transmitted from bats to palm civets ( guan et al. , 2003 ) or dromedary camels ( drosten et al. , 2014 ) , and finally to humans ( cui et al. , 2019 ) .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.02.001|coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and are genetically classified into four major genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus (li, 2016) . the former two genera primarily infect mammals, whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds (tang et al., 2015) . six kinds of human covs have been previously identified. these include hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e, which belong to the alphacoronavirus genus; and hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), which belong to the beta-coronavirus genus (tang et al., 2015) . coronaviruses did not attract worldwide attention until the 2003 sars pandemic, followed by the 2012 mers and, most recently, the 2019-ncov outbreaks (china cdc, 2020; song et al., 2019) . sars-cov and mers-cov are considered highly pathogenic (cui et al., 2019) , and it is very likely that both sars-cov and mers-cov were transmitted from bats to palm civets (guan et al., 2003) or dromedary camels (drosten et al., 2014) , and finally to humans (cui et al., 2019) .

(h1n1, 1918) : the virus from this pandemic, which killed about 40 million people, had not been isolated. without a virus little research was possible, then the viral rna sequence was determined using material from archival tissue, including formalin-fixed autopsy material. the sequence itself did not provide clues for why the spanish influenza virus was so virulent, and so the next step was to reconstruct the viral coding segments and clone them into plasmids. individual genes from the h1n1 1918 virus were then introduced into a common laboratory viral strain and pathogenicity sought. although the h and n glycoproteins were factors in the virulence of this virus, it was also shown that one of the rna polymerase subunits known as pb1 was involved. another subunit (pb2) was then found to be important for viral transmissibility [35] . swine influenza (h1n1, later called h1n1(09), 2009): after the appearance and then rapid disappearance of sars (box 6.4), followed by the concerns regarding the possibility of a h5n1 pandemic that did not occur (so far), this infection attracted a lot of publicity and provoked considerable fear when it emerged in china and then hong kong in 2003. sars subsequently spread to many countries, producing around 700 deaths in the first half of 2003. this was at one time described as the first pandemic of the 21st century, but it never progressed beyond an epidemic because of effective public health measures effected by mid 2003 [36] . the social and economic impacts of this infection were considerable, including major disruptions to international travel. sars was shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus (cov) which was thought to have crossed the species barrier, although the animal reservoir for sars took a while to find. it is now thought to be:

(2007) reported a previously unrecognized coronavirus lineage detected from wild asian leopard cats and chinese ferret badgers from samples collected in southern china in 2006 . in 2009 , woo et al. (2009b reported identification of three novel avian coronaviruses in wild birds (bulbul cov hku11, thrush cov hku12, and munia cov hku13). these three novel avian covs and covs identified from asian leopard cats and chinese ferret badgers all belong to the newly established deltacoronavirus genus (woo et al., 2010 (woo et al., , 2012 . in 2012, identification of seven additional novel deltacoronaviruses in pigs and birds were reported (woo et al., 2012) . among deltacoronaviruses, pdcov is most genetically similar to covs in asian leopard cats based on available helicase, spike and nucleocapsid gene sequences (woo et al., 2012) . it is unknown how dcovs were transmitted between small mammals (such as asian leopard cats and chinese ferret badgers) and domestic pigs. a model of cov evolution has been proposed in which bats are the gene source of alphacoronavirus and betacornoavirus whereas birds are the gene source of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus (woo et al., 2009a (woo et al., , 2012 . it is likely that dcovs are transmitted from wild birds to small mammals and/or domestic pigs. more surveillance and sequence data are needed in order to understand interspecies transmission of dcovs between wild birds and small mammals, between wild birds and domestic pigs, and/or between small mammals and domestic pigs.
('bovine','canine')|it has been suggested that crcov might share the same ancestor in this clade , or originated from a host transfer from bovine to canine ( erles et al. , 2003 ) .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7089282/pdf/|coronaviruses are classified phylogenetically into four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. alphacoronaviruses include human coronaviruses hcov-229e and hcov-nl63, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev), feline coronavirus (fcov), and ccov. four human coronaviruses hcov-oc43, sars-cov, hcov-hku1, mers-cov and bovine coronavirus (bcov), as well as crcov, are betacoronaviruses, but belong to different subgroups. phylogenetically, ccov is closely related to hcov-229e and hcov-nl63, while crcov is close to bcov and hcov-oc43. it has been suggested that crcov might share the same ancestor in this clade, or originated from a host transfer from bovine to canine (erles et al., 2003) .
('camel', 'human')|85 , 86 later , rising mers-cov antibodies were documented in the patient , suggesting that mers-cov infection was transmitted from the camels to the human and not vice versa .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4809235/pdf/|multiple lines of evidence implicate dromedary camels in the emergence and transmission of mers-cov. firstly, mers-cov antibodies are highly prevalent in dromedary camels from across the arabian peninsula, north africa and eastern africa ( figure 1 and table 1 ). [29] [30] [31] 34, [69] [70] [71] mers-cov antibodies were detected in stored camel sera dating as far back as early 1990s, suggesting that mers-cov may have been circulating in dromedaries for over 20 years before it was first recognized as a cause of human infection. 32, 71, 72 the prevalence of mers-cov antibodies is significantly higher in older camels compared with those aged two years or less. 31, 32, 73, 74 interestingly, despite the high overall prevalence of mers-cov seropositivity in dromedary camels from kenya, no mers-cov antibodies were detected in those from the north eastern region where dromedaries have been raised largely in isolation from those in the rest of the country. 71 similarly, all dromedaries raised at the dubai central veterinary research laboratory, which had no contact with other camels, were seronegative for mers-cov. 75 also noteworthy is that 15 of 105 dromedary camels from the canary islands were seropositive for mers-cov. although the majority of camels in the herd were born and bred in the canary islands, the group included three camels that were imported from morocco. 29 in contrast, no mers-cov antibodies were detected in dromedary camels from australia, canada, the united states of america, germany, the netherlands or japan. 29, 34, 72, 75, 76 the high prevalence of mers-cov seropositivity in africa and the middle east suggests that animal movement has facilitated the transmission and circulation of mers-cov amongst dromedary camels in these regions. mers-cov antibodies have neither been found in mongolian or dutch bactrian camels, nor in south american camelids such as lamas, alpacas and guanacos. 29, 77 the second line of evidence is the reported detection of mers-cov by rt-pcr in oro-nasal and faecal samples from dromedary camels in multiple locations in the arabian peninsula ( figure 1 and table 2 ). 32, 70, 73, 74, [78] [79] [80] [81] the four of 110 dromedary camels in which mers-cov rna was detected in egypt were all imported from sudan or ethiopia for slaughter. 82 of particular concern is the particularly high rate of mers-cov rna detection in camels presented for slaughter in eastern saudi arabia and qatar; the latter was in the vicinity of a market in doha to which two prior human cases were linked. 78, 79 overall, mers-cov is more commonly detected and in higher viral loads in nasal swabs than in faecal samples. 32, 73, 74 another notable observation is that sequences from mers-cov strains isolated several months apart within the same location are often identical to one another, indicating that mers-cov circulation in dromedary herds is very stable. 73, 74 interestingly, the prevalence of mers-cov rna shedding is significantly higher in juvenile than in adult camels that had prior evidence of mers-cov seropositivity, indicating that animal re-infection is possible. 73, 74, 79, 83 the third level of evidence is the demonstration of active mers-cov infection in dromedary camels through documented rises in anti-mers-cov antibody titres. 73, 74, 85, 86 mers-cov was also detected by rt-pcr in symptomatic camels. 73, 74, 78, 83, 85, 86 dromedaries with active mers-cov infection exhibited symptoms such muco-purulent nasal and lachrymal discharge, cough, sneezing, fever and loss of appetite. 73, 78, 85, 86 it was initially argued that detection of mers-cov in camels by rt-pcr is not necessarily evidence of shedding of infectious virus and thus transmissibility of mers-cov between dromedaries and humans. 87, 88 however, several groups have since been able to isolate viable mers-cov in cell cultures of nasal and faecal samples from dromedary camels. 73, 74, 80, 84, 89 moreover, the potential infectiousness of mers-cov recovered from dromedary camels was evident by its capability to cause ex-vivo infection in human respiratory cells and human hepatoma cells (huh-7) . 80, 90 successful mers-cov cultures usually coincide with corresponding high viral loads in the same specimens. 73, 80, 82, 84 the fifth level of evidence is the successful experimental mers-cov infection of dromedary camels with resultant mild clinical infection manifesting as fever and rhinorrhea. 91 three mers-cov seronegative adult dromedary camels were inoculated via intranasal, intra-tracheal camels. 32, 73, 74, 78 in one prospective study, mers-cov detection by rt-pcr in dromedary camels was highest in the period between the months of november and january, coinciding with the dromedaries' calving season. 78 this, along with the observed increased incidence of human mers-cov infection during the period between march and may, suggests that juvenile camels are an important source of new infections in camels and potentially hum ans. 73, 74, 78 mers-cov rna prevalence data also indicate that animal movement may facilitate the introduction of mers-cov into herds of dromedaries. for example, phylogenetic analysis of mers-cov strains that were detected in a herd of dromedary camels in dubai showed that they were closely related to those circulating in eastern saudi arabia, where some of the camels had recently grazed. 74 in another example, a group of camels imported from oman was screened by rt-pcr on arrival in uae and was found positive for mers-cov. 83 moreover, mers-cov strains isolated from dromedary camels in eastern saudi arabia were phylogenetically related to those isolated from camels several hundred kilometres away in buraidah, central saudi arabia. 73 most significantly, phylogenetic analyses of partial and whole mers-cov genomes from dromedary camels show that they are clustered within human isolates, supporting possible camel-human intertransmission. 32, 70, 73, 74, 78, 80, 82, 84 rt-pcr was positive in co-worker were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection. mers-cov was detected by rt-pcr in five of their 14 camels. 89 alignment of six mers-cov genomic fragments, covering 4.2 kb of the mers-cov genome, from the camels and the human cases showed that they differed by one nucleotide each in orf1a and orf4b regions. 89 in november 2013, a 43-year-old man died in a hospital in jeddah, saudi arabia, with severe mers-cov infection. he had owned a herd of nine dromedary camels, some of which were reported to have had recent respiratory symptoms. mers-cov was detected by pcr and culture of nasal specimens from one camel. 85, 86 partial mers-cov sequence of 4.6 kb from the camel and the linked human isolates differed in only two positions. 85 whole mers-cov genome sequences obtained from viral cultures of the human and camel isolates were 100% identical. 86 importantly, 4-fold rise in mers-cov antibody titres was documented in the camels, indicating that active mers-cov infection was probably circulating in the dromedary herd. 85, 86 later, rising mers-cov antibodies were documented in the patient, suggesting that mers-cov infection was transmitted from the camels to the human and not vice versa. 86 in may 2015, mers-cov was detected in eight asymptomatic dromedary camels at entry into uae from oman. two asymptomatic men, aged 29 and 33 years, who were in contact with the camels were found to be positive for mers-cov rna in their respiratory samples. 83 partial sequences of mers-cov spike, orf3-4a and nucleocapsid regions from the human and linked camels were and conjunctival routes with a total dose of 10 7 50% tissue culture infective dose (tcid 50 ) of mers-cov. clinical symptoms appeared within 2 days and persisted for up to 2 weeks. submucosal inflammation and necrosis were evident in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, but not the alveoli. mers-cov antibodies were detected within 14 days of inoculation. shedding of infectious mers-cov in oral and nasal secretions, as determined by plaque assay titres, continued for up 5 and 7 days, respectively. mers-cov was detectable by quantitative pcr for up to 35 days. 91 under certain condition, mers-cov can survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 30 hours. 92 moreover, mers-cov rna can be detected in milk expressed from mers-cov infected camels. 93 whether mers-cov is secreted in camel milk or it is contaminated from the animal's other body secretions is probably immaterial as viable mers-cov can be recovered from dromedary camel milk stored at 22 degrees celsius for up to 48 hours. 94 it is therefore possible to envisage that in the absence of appropriate precautions, the environment surrounding a mers-cov infected camel can become extensively contaminated with viable, potentially infectious virus.

('camel','human')|since its first outbreak in 2012 , the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases , causing 851 deaths .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1101/2019.12.18.881391|middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) is a major emerging zoonotic infectious disease. since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. to date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against mers-cov, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. a critical step in the life cycle of mers-cov is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (s) protein as main determinant of viral entry. proteolytic cleavage of s exposes its fusion peptide (fp), which initiates membrane fusion. previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) fp have shown that calcium (ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (e) and aspartic acid (d) residues. sars-cov and mers-cov fp share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether ca2+ is required for mers-cov fusion by substituting e and d residues in the mers-cov fp with neutrally charged alanines. upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (pps) on host cells without and with ca2+. our results demonstrate that intracellular ca2+ enhances mers-cov wt pps infection by approximately two-fold and that e891 is a crucial residue for ca2+ interaction. electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to ca2+ increasing mers-cov fp fusion-relevant membrane ordering. intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that mers-cov fp binds one ca2+, as opposed to sars-cov fp which binds two. our data suggests that there are significant differences in fp-ca2+ interactions of mers-cov and sars-cov fp despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of ca2+ ions interacting with the fp has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.

('cat','bat')|the emergence of the sars coronavirus around 2002 probably involved the transfer of the virus from a bat to a carnivore ( probably a civet cat ) ; contact with civets may have facilitated the human outbreak .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2831534/pdf/|mechanisms of viral emergence vet. res. (2010) 41:38 and re-emergences of human viral diseases, that have amounted to about one per year during the last decades, have been associated with rna viruses that display active recombination or reassortment. as examples, several recent poliomyelitis outbreaks have been related to viruses generated by recombination between attenuated vaccine polioviruses and other circulating enteroviruses [75] . as an historical event, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus appears to have acquired its hemagglutinin-esterase gene by recombination with an influenza type c virus [46] . also, the alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus probably resulted from an ancient recombination between a sindbis-like and a easter-equine encephalitis-like virus (reviewed in [87] ). the emergence of the sars coronavirus around 2002 probably involved the transfer of the virus from a bat to a carnivore (probably a civet cat); contact with civets may have facilitated the human outbreak. the human ace2 receptor-binding sequences used by the human sars coronavirus may have been acquired by recombination with a preexisting group 1 human coronavirus [45] . in this, and in the other cases in which recombination played a role in the generation of a new pathogen, selection of virus variants for a more efficient replication in the new host (for receptor use or other) probably took place [91] . genome segment reassortment is a major evolutionary force for some viruses with a segmented genome, the most studied case being reassortments in the influenza type a viruses. reassortants that have acquired the hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase genes from viruses of some animal reservoirs (notably birds or swine) have been associated with the major human influenza pandemics such as the spanish influenza of 1918 (h1n1 virus), the hong kong influenza of 1968 (h3n2 virus) or the pandemics of 2009 (h1n1 virus) [35, 66, 74] . such viruses acquired a selective advantage relative to previously circulating influenza viruses because the new hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase surface antigens were not recognized (or were only poorly recognized) by the neutralizing antibodies present in the human population. the acquisition of new genome segments that produce a change in antigenic specificity is termed antigenic shift. the gradual antigenic modification undergone by the virus as it circulates in the human population is termed antigenic drift. the latter is linked to point mutations that affect the antigenic determinants, and can be regarded as the fitness adjustment by mutation as the virus explores new environments (some of which include anti-influenza antibodies) following a reassortment event. drastic and gradual versions of antigenic variation are not exclusive of influenza virus, and they have been amply recognized as a major factor in the adaptation of viruses to host organisms endowed with an immune system [48, 67] . viruses are undoubtedly subjected to selective constraints additional to the several components of an immune response, and some of them probably have not even been identified. multiple constraints contribute to shape the genomic compositions of the viral populations as they complete successive life cycles. mutation, recombination and reassortment can produce new viral forms, a minority of which might be competent to replicate in a new environment. there is evidence that a true recombinant hemagglutinin might have been one of the virulence determinants of the influenza pandemics of 1918 [28] .

combination therapy with pyrimethamine at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours may help the prognosis. 14 supportive care such as oxygen therapy maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is also important. successful treatment of clinical feline toxoplasmosis has been described infrequently. 14, 59, 143 heartworm despite prevalence studies demonstrating a worldwide distribution and recognizing heartworm infection in up to 18% of cats tested,* the prevalence rate being approximately 5% to 10% of that found in dogs, 84, 150, 153 * references 31, 71, 84, 107, 138, 150, 151, 155, 158, 197, 269, 285. prevalence being found similar to that of fiv and felv infection, 150, 151, 158 feline heartworm disease remains underdiagnosed in general practice. 30, 195 this is likely because clinical signs vary dramatically from no signs to sudden death and definitive diagnosis can be difficult. 20, 30, 153, 196 heartworm disease is caused by the filarioid nematode dirofilaria immitis, which is transmitted by mosquitos and for which dogs are the usual definitive host. therefore a prerequisite for heartworm infection is a climate with adequate temperature and humidity to support a viable mosquito population and allow maturation of larvae within the intermediate host. the sexually dimorphic adult heartworm mate within an infected dog's pulmonary artery, producing immature forms called microfilariae. circulating microfilariae are ingested by mosquitoes feeding on infected dogs. within mosquitoes, microfilariae transform into larval stages. there are five larval stages (l1 to l5); l1 to l3 transformations occur within the mosquito, and l3 is the form that is transmitted from mosquitos to dogs and cats. maturation from l3 to other larval stages occurs in subcutaneous tissues and peripheral veins of mammalian hosts; immature worms in peripheral veins are carried in the bloodstream to and through the heart, with adult heartworms ultimately residing at the caudal pulmonary arteries. 1 there are significant differences between feline and canine heartworm disease because the parasite is only partially adapted to the cat. the cat is susceptible to heartworm infection but more resistant than the dog. the cat represents a dead-end host because it cannot act as a reservoir for infection. the prepatent period in the cat is 7 to 8 months (1 to 2 months longer than in dogs). 169 in dogs, most juvenile worms mature into adults that can live for 5 to 7 years, whereas in cats most juvenile worms die shortly after arriving in the pulmonary arteries, instigating a severe vascular and parenchymal inflammatory response. pulmonary lesions may be long lasting. the clinical response in the cat has been termed heartworm-associated respiratory disease (hard). in a small percentage of cats, a few worms develop to mature adults that can live for 2 to 3 years. 195 cats with adult heartworms develop pulmonary changes characterized by intimal proliferation, eosinophilic endarteritis, intimal fibrosis, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. arterial wall changes can lead to pulmonary hypertension with resultant pulmonary arterial distention. 173 damage can be caused by juvenile heartworms without development to the adult stage, resulting in increase in thickness of the pulmonary arterial wall that in turn causes occlusion. 26, 56 there have been suggestions that wolbachia pipientis, a symbiotic gram-negative intracellular bacterium harbored by d. immitis induces further pulmonary pathology. 57 a strong antibody response against wolbachia surface protein has american heartworm society, the primary reasons for heartworm testing in cats are as follows:

('civet','human')|15 for group b betacovs , sarsr-cov is believed to be transmitted from civet to humans , although it is the horseshoe bat that was likely the primary host .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3630921/pdf/|after the sars epidemic, we started to focus on cov biodiversity, genomics and phylogeny and built up an evolutionary map of cov evolution. before 2003, there were less than 10 covs with complete genomes available, which include two human covs, human coronavirus 229e (hcov-229e) and human coronavirus oc43 (hcov-oc43). by september 2012, the number of covs with complete genomes sequenced had tripled. it includes two additional human covs, human coronavirus nl63 (hcov-nl63) and human coronavirus hku1 (hcov-hku1). 2,3 traditionally, covs were classified into groups 1, 2 and 3. in 2011, the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses has re-classified these three groups of covs as three genera, alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus; and we have discovered a fourth genus of cov, deltacoronavirus, which includes at least nine avian covs and a porcine coronavirus hku15. 4, 5 within the betacovs, they are further subclassified into group a, including hcov-hku1, hcov-oc43, bovine coronavirus (bcov), sable antelope coronavirus, giraffe coronavirus, equine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, murine hepatitis virus, rat coronavirus and rabbit coronavirus hku14 (rbcov hku14); 6 group b, including the human and civet sars-related covs (sarsr-cov) and sars-related rhinolophus bat coronavirus (sarsr-rh-batcov); 7,8 group c, including tylonycteris bat coronavirus hku4 (ty-batcov hku4) and pipistrellus bat coronavirus hku5 (pi-batcov hku5) we discovered in 2006; 9,10 and group d, including rousettus bat coronavirus hku9 (ro-batcov hku9). 10, 11 in addition to ty-batcov hku4 and pi-batcov hku5, other group c bat betacovs should also be present, but their complete genome sequences are not available. 12, 13 based on the covs discovered, we have constructed a model of cov evolution, with evidence supporting that bat covs are the gene source of alphacovs and betacovs and avian covs are the gene source of gammacovs and deltacovs. 5 all these works have laid down an evolutionary map for rapid phylogenetic and bioinformatics analyses of hcov-emc. the diversity of covs is a result t of the infidelity of rdrp which make cov genomes especially plastic, a high frequency of homologous rna recombination due to their unique random template switching during rna replication, and their large genomes. in addition to biodiversity, a number of natural recombination and possible interspecies jumping events has also been documented in betacovs. 6, 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] for group a betacovs, molecular clock analysis has shown that hcov-oc43 is a relatively recent zoonotic virus of bovine origin that emerged in around 1890 likely from bovine-to-human transmission. 17 we have also recently discovered rbcov hku14, closely related to other members of the species betacoronavirus 1 including hcov-oc43 and bcov, with recombination events that may have played a role in interspecies transmission of these hcov-oc43related viruses between human, cattle, rabbits, swine and horses. 6 despite having circulated in humans for more than a century, hcov-oc43 is also found to be continuously evolving, with the recent emergence of a novel genotype due to natural recombination. 15 for group b betacovs, sarsr-cov is believed to be transmitted from civet to humans, although it is the horseshoe bat that was likely the primary host. 7, 8 civet sarsr-cov was also likely a recombinant virus arising from different strains of sarsr-rh-batcov from different geographical locations in china. 14, 16 although no interspecies transmission events have been documented in group d betacovs, we have also identified recombination events between different ro-batcov hku9 strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. 11 while these findings supported that betacovs have the propensity to recombine and cause interspecies transmission, such events were unknown in group c betacovs. as hcov-emc is most closely related to ty-batcov hku4 and pi-batcov hku5, it would be important to study their genetic relatedness, which may provide clues on whether bats are the possible origin as in sarsr-cov.
('civet','human')|for example , previous sars research reported that the interspecies transfer of sarslike coronaviruses from bats to the amplifying host ( e.g. , civet ) occurred in 1998 and that interspecies transfer from civet to humans occurred in 2002 ( chinese , 2004 ; hon et al. , 2008 ; lau et al. , 2010 ; song et al. , 2005 ) .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.04.031|a newly enteric coronavirus, pdcov, was identified in the usa in 2014, and this coronavirus caused clinical signs in swine similar to those of pedv (wang et al., 2014a) . in this study, a novel peav (peav-gd-ch/2017) strain was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea, and this strain shares high identities with the other two peav strains that were previously reported (gong et al., 2017; pan et al., 2017) . these novel peavs are most identical to bat-hku2, with 95% nucleotide identity, and have the same genome organization and trs motif for each orf. the greatest difference between peav and bat-hku2 is their s proteins, which share 85% amino acid identity each other, a value much lower compared with those of other proteins (table 1) . this difference is caused by amino acid mutations in the s protein, particularly in the ntd in the s1 subunit, which has been proven to be the key factor determining issue tropism and the host range of coronaviruses (lu et al., 2015) . in addition to its low amino acid identity with the s protein of hku2-like coronavirus, it shares low amino acid identity (lower than 28%) with s proteins of all known coronaviruses. thus, clarifying the origin of the s proteins of peav and hku2-like coronavirus is important for determining the origin and evolutionary history of these coronaviruses. a previous study showed that the extreme ntd in the s1 subunit of peav is structurally similar to that of nl63, while the rest of the s1 subunit is structurally similar to that of mhv (pan et al., 2017) . in addition, a short peptide in the s protein of bat-hku2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the receptor-binding motif (rbm) in the s1 subunit of sars-cov (lau et al., 2007) . we also analyzed the arginine (position 545) at cleavage sites s1/s2 of peav and found that it is conserved in several beta-covs in this study. moreover, the phylogenetic tree based on the s protein presents a uniform evolutionary relationship; these bat-hku2like coronaviruses cluster with a newly identified rat-cov, lrnv, which represents a novel species of coronaviruses. all of these strains form a distinct lineage and cluster with beta-covs but are separate from all four known subgroups of beta-covs (fig. 3) , which may indicate that these strains are part of a novel subgroup of beta-covs. these results suggest that peav and hku2-like coronaviruses may have some relations with beta-covs and most likely resulted from recombination with the backbone of alpha-cov and the s gene from an unrecognized beta-cov. another large difference between peav and bat-hku2 is n protein, which share about 93.9% amino acid identity, as n protein is a multifunctional protein for coronaviruses, which is involving in virus replication, budding and pathogenesis et al. (mcbride et al., 2014) . while the role of these mutations in n protein between peav and bat-hku2 should further investigate. the origin and emergence time of a newly emerged pathogen are important issues to answer to determine the evolutionary history and plan methods of prevention for these new pathogens. for example, previous sars research reported that the interspecies transfer of sarslike coronaviruses from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civet) occurred in 1998 and that interspecies transfer from civet to humans occurred in 2002 (chinese, 2004; hon et al., 2008; lau et al., 2010; song et al., 2005) . these results provide insight into the origin and evolutionary history of sars coronavirus. the origin and divergence time of other coronaviruses have also been estimated previously; the divergence time of bovine-cov and hcov-oc43 could be dated back to the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and was estimated at 1910 (vijgen et al., 2006) . the tmrca for all pdcov strains was reported at 1991, approximately 24 years before pdcov was identified (woo et al., 2017) . in this study, we also addressed the emergence time and evolutionary history of peav and of the other coronaviruses based on the rdrp gene by bayesian analysis. in anticipation, the mean divergence time of bovine-cov and hcov-oc43 was estimated at 1914, and the mean tmrca of human and civet sarsr-cov was estimated at 2001 in our analysis (fig. 4) . these results are highly consistent with those of a previous report discussed above and further indicate that our analysis is unbiased. the emergence time of peav was estimated at 1926 (95% hpd, 1864 to 1984) based on our analysis, which indicates that peav is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since interspecies transmission from bat to swine occurred. in addition, these hku2-like coronaviruses have a common ancestor with hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e, and the divergence time was estimated at 277, which indicates that these hku2-like coronaviruses have a long evolutionary history. the mean tmrca for alpha-cov, beta-cov, and gamma-cov, as well as those of all coronaviruses estimated in this study, were later compared with those of a previous report (woo et al., 2012) . nevertheless, the mean tmrca coincides with the regions with 95% hpd to each other. the evolutionary rate of different coronaviruses was estimated previously; 4.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year was estimated for hcov-oc43 (vijgen et al., 2005) , and the mean evolutionary rate for group 1b coronaviruses was estimated to be 3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (pyrc et al., 2006) . in addition, the evolutionary rate for all coronaviruses was estimated to be 1.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (woo et al., 2012) , which is estimated to be 1.93 × 10 −4 (95% hpd, 1.27 × 10 −4 to 3.57 × 10 −4 ) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the rdrp gene in this study, and all of these results are comparable to each other.
('civet','human')|it is believed that a novel coronavirus , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars-cov ) , was passed from palm civets to humans and caused the epidemic of sars in 2002 to 2003 .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2446986/pdf/|it is believed that a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), was passed from palm civets to humans and caused the epidemic of sars in 2002 to 2003. the major species barriers between humans and civets for sars-cov infections are the specific interactions between a defined receptor-binding domain (rbd) on a viral spike protein and its host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2). in this study a chimeric ace2 bearing the critical n-terminal helix from civet and the remaining peptidase domain from human was constructed, and it was shown that this construct has the same receptor activity as civet ace2. in addition, crystal structures of the chimeric ace2 complexed with rbds from various human and civet sars-cov strains were determined. these structures, combined with a previously determined structure of human ace2 complexed with the rbd from a human sars-cov strain, have revealed a structural basis for understanding the major species barriers between humans and civets for sars-cov infections. they show that the major species barriers are determined by interactions between four ace2 residues (residues 31, 35, 38, and 353) and two rbd residues (residues 479 and 487), that early civet sars-cov isolates were prevented from infecting human cells due to imbalanced salt bridges at the hydrophobic virus/receptor interface, and that sars-cov has evolved to gain sustained infectivity for human cells by eliminating unfavorable free charges at the interface through stepwise mutations at positions 479 and 487. these results enhance our understanding of host adaptations and cross-species infections of sars-cov and other emerging animal viruses.
('civet','human')|perhaps the most well-known example of viral cross-species transmission involves the sars-cov. studies support a transmission model in which a sars-like cov was transmitted from rhinolophus bats to palm civets , which subsequently transmitted the palm civet-adapted virus to humans at local food markets in southern china .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.08.004|as the ctr of the s 1 subunit contains the protein rbd for most covs, also mutations in this part of s have been associated with changes in the virus' tropism. perhaps the most well-known example of viral cross-species transmission involves the sars-cov. studies support a transmission model in which a sars-like cov was transmitted from rhinolophus bats to palm civets, which subsequently transmitted the palm civet-adapted virus to humans at local food markets in southern china . according to this model, sars-like viruses adapted to both the palm civet and human host, which was reflected in the rapid viral evolution observed for these viruses within these species . two-amino acid substitutions within the rbd were elucidated that are of relevance for binding to the ace2 proteins of palm civets and humans (li et al., 2005b qu et al., 2005) . from these studies it appears that due to strong conservation of ace2 between mammalian species only a few amino acid alterations within the rbd are needed to change coronavirus host species tropism. indeed serial passage of sars-covs in vitro or in vivo can rapidly lead to adaptation to new host species (roberts et al., 2007) . sars-like viruses isolated from bats displayed major differences including a deletion in the ace2 rbm compared to human sars-cov (drexler et al., 2010; ren et al., 2008) and as a consequence were unable of using human ace2 as an entry receptor (becker et al., 2008) . however, recently a novel sarslike btcov was identified, which could use ace2 of rhinolophus bats, palm civets as well as of humans as a functional receptor . these findings not only provide further evidence that bats are indeed the natural reservoir for sars-like covs, but also that these bat coronaviruses can directly include human ace2 in their receptor repertoire. the detection of sequences of sars-cov-like viruses in palm civets and raccoon dogs (guan et al., 2003; tu et al., 2004) therefore probably reflects the unusually wide host range of these viruses. a similar promiscuous receptor usage is also observed for mers-cov which binds to dpp4 of many species (barlan et al., 2014; eckerle et al., 2014; falzarano et al., 2014; m€ uller et al., 2012; van doremalen et al., 2014) as indicated earlier.

(fig. 1 ). an example of a serious and widespread bacterial infection is mosquito-transmitted plasmodium falciparum, causing malaria in many tropical regions. malaria causes significant morbidity and co-morbidity in these regions in which it is endemic. due to the complex life cycle of the causative bacterium, it has been challenging to achieve a vaccine for malaria. the most advanced candidate is the rts,s/as01 vaccine [18] , which is undergoing a pilot implementation in three countries in sub-saharan africa, with a view to determining its impact on disease prior to a wider implementation [19] . despite the availability of approved vaccines [20, 21] , typhoid fever and cholera remain significantly debilitating enteric diseases in regions of the world where hygienic living conditions are poor and there is little access to health care. both infections are caused by bacteria (salmonella typhi and vibrio cholera, respectively) which exist in contaminated water and food. tuberculosis (tb) is a respiratory infection which is widespread globally. caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, and transmitted to man from zoonotic reservoirs (badgers, cattle) with a high potential for subsequent human-to-human transmission, tb is prevalent in susceptible individuals living in overcrowded conditions [22] . although the bcg vaccine has been in routine use for many years, variable efficacy has been reported, depending on region of use [23, 24] with 60-80% reported in the united kingdom but lower levels in equatorial countries. the emergence of multi-drugresistant tb (mdr tb) in recent years raises the bar for treatment of this disease and makes a high level of vaccine efficacy even more important [25] . examples of zoonotic reservoirs which maintain endemic viral diseases are numerous and are summarized in table 3 . in particular, viral endemic disease is caused by the coronaviruses (mers and sars) in saudi arabia and the eastern mediterranean countries; and by the lassa arenavirus, which is endemic in west african countries and caused a serious outbreak of lassa fever in nigeria in 2018 [26] ; other viruses which are endemic and cause viral haemorrhagic fever include dengue, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide [27] , the filoviruses (ebola and marburg) which have a zoonotic reservoir in bats in sub-saharan africa [28] ; and yellow fever virus, which is prevalent in africa, central and south america and the caribbean [29] . interestingly, the same mosquito (aedes aegypti) which spreads yellow fever virus also transmits the dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses [30] . chikungunya virus has a widespread distribution in africa, asia, india and south america and with occasional cases in europe, and causes a debilitating, but rarely fatal, disease [31] . zika virus emerged in brazil in 2015 [32] , although it was first detected in monkeys in uganda as early as 1947 [33] , and the first documented human case occurred in nigeria in 1954 [34] . the large brazilian outbreak of zika viral disease culminated in 2017, with thousands of cases reported [35] . rift valley fever virus (rvfv) is another zoonotic virus which is endemic in sub-saharan africa and primarily infects cattle, sheep and goats, but can be transmitted to man by mosquito bite to cause an acute fever [36] . an example of a bacterium which has been classed as a re-emerging pathogen and which is endemic in global regions is y. pestis, causative of plague. bubonic [37] [38] [39] . over thousands of years, y. pestis has evolved away from the enteric yersinia species to become a lethal flea-transmitted bacterium [40] . it is transmitted to man, typically from a zoonotic reservoir in infected rats or other rodents (e.g. ground squirrels or prairie dogs), by flea-bite to cause bubonic plague [41] (fig. 2 ). if not detected and treated, this can develop into either septicemic plague or the most serious form of all, a secondary pneumonic plague. in turn, individuals with pneumonic plague can transmit this by aerosol droplet to others, to establish a primary pneumonic plague infection. each year, a few cases of plague are also reported in the southwestern united states, where the disease has been endemic in the rodent population since the late 1800s [42] . as well as infecting the rodent population, infected fleas can spread y. pestis to other wildlife species (e.g. rabbits/hares or, rarely, domesticated animals [43] ) which, in turn, raises the potential of transmission to man by inhalation to cause a primary pneumonic plague. in endemic areas, outbreaks of plague are often associated with seasonal environmental changes, causing rodents to stray closer to human habitation. the plague outbreak in madagascar during 2017/18 was particularly serious, with an estimated 2671 cases and 239 deaths (8·9% fatality rate) [44] . this outbreak was approximately sixfold greater than usual, with an unusual predominance of pneumonic, rather than bubonic plague.
('fox','human')|we have divided the virus infections into two categories , those that are transmitted to humans directly from vertebrate animals ( like rodents , foxes , bats and birds ) and those that are primarily transmitted by arthropods ( mosquitoes , ticks , sandflies ) .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/j.femsre.2005.04.012|during the past 15 years a number of new virus infections have emerged or re-emerged. most of them, such as sin nombre and andes hantaviruses, sars coronavirus, avian influenza, nipah and hendra viruses, have appeared in subtropical or tropical regions. dengue is spreading to new areas and west nile virus has reached the new world. infections by several of these viruses may lead to high mortality and also attract attention because they are potential bioweapons. some viruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus are spreading to new areas along with climate and environmental changes. most of these infections are zoonoses and clearly viruses shared by animals and humans are, unlike human-only viruses, much more difficult to eradicate. here, we review zoonotic virus infections occurring in europe. the infections like lassa fever and dengue that are imported to europe but are not indigenous to european nature will not be discussed in detail in the review. we have divided the virus infections into two categories, those that are transmitted to humans directly from vertebrate animals (like rodents, foxes, bats and birds) and those that are primarily transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies). the latter class is formed by arboviruses but notably they have vertebrate hosts in nature.

('horse','human')|the hendra virus was passed from the pteropus bat to horses , followed by transmission from horses to humans .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc6849485/pdf/|humans are nowadays very often in contact with pets or farm animals such as cattle, pigs, poultry, and horses. although there are many infectious diseases typically found in people working with livestock, according to the microorganisms-driven genetic selection theory humans should have less to fear from livestock than from wild animals regarding the risk of deadly zoonotic diseases since they shared the same ecosystem with livestock for millennia. this does not mean humans should not remain vigilant (this is the reason why milk pasteurization exists and why meat must be cooked before consumption) and not worry about pathogens abnormally present in their livestock because of the interconnectedness of different ecosystems. despite veterinary figure 3
('human', 'bat')|however , with rare direct contacts between such bats and humans , similar to sars-cov and mers-cov , it seems to be more likely that the spillover of 2019-ncov to humans from another intermediate host rather than directly from bats .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.954628|not soon after the release of the 2019-ncov genome, a scientist released a full genome of a coronavirus, bat-cov-ratg13, from bat (rhinolophus sinicus), which is colonized in yunan province, nearly 2,000 km away from wuhan. bat-cov-ratg13 was 96% identical at the whole genome level to the 2019-ncov, suggesting the 2019-ncov, could be of bat origin [10] . however, with rare direct contacts between such bats and humans, similar to sars-cov and mers-cov, it seems to be more likely that the spillover of 2019-ncov to humans from another intermediate host rather than directly from bats.
('human','bat')|although an origin of sars-related cov in bats is confi rmed ( 9 , 36 ) , sars-cov precursors have existed in carnivores some time before the sars epidemic and have been transmitted from carnivores to humans again at least one additional time after the end of the epidemic ( 37 , 38 ) .|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3165994/pdf/|another intriguing fi nding of our study was the difference in the amplifi cation pattern of the rna viruses and that of the dna virus. we selected these viruses because, in humans, advs are typically capable of persisting in tissue (34) and thus do not depend so much on continuous transmission and consistent amplifi cation on the population level. indeed, it appeared that adv did not make use of periodic amplifi cation in our bat colony. persistence on the level of individual bats is more common for dna viruses than for rna viruses. rna viruses ensure that they are maintained on a population level by a much higher error rate of the enzymes they use for genome replication and consequent higher levels of antigenic variability, causing waves of epidemic spread as confi rmed for bat-borne rna viruses in this study. this factor can explain why most emerging viruses, including those from bats, are indeed rna viruses (2, 35) . for cov, our study indicates clearly that virus amplifi cation takes place in maternity colonies, confi rming our earlier statistical implications from studies in a different region and on a different species (16) . high peak rna concentrations in the range of 10 9 -10 10 copies/g were observed, which is tremendously higher than cov concentrations observed in earlier studies outside the parturition period (19) . similarly high rna virus concentrations are observed in human diseases transmitted through the fecal-oral route, e.g., picornaviruses or noroviruses, which suggests that maternity roosts may involve an elevated risk of virus transmission to other hosts. it is interesting to reconsider the potential genesis of the sars epidemic in this light. although an origin of sars-related cov in bats is confi rmed (9, 36) , sars-cov precursors have existed in carnivores some time before the sars epidemic and have been transmitted from carnivores to humans again at least one additional time after the end of the epidemic (37, 38) . these data provide an intriguing explanation of how the sars agent may have left its original reservoir (39, 40) . the data also indicate a feasible and ecologically sensible means of prevention. because carnivores are known to enter maternity roosts to feed on dead newborn bats, bat maternity roosts should be left undisturbed by humans and kept inaccessible to domestic cats and dogs.

('human','pig')|although unlikely , the possibility that sars-cov positive animals were infected from humans can not be formally excluded , and it was indeed reported that sars-cov was transmitted from man to pig [ 7 ] .|https://api.semanticscholar.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2005.07.075|in 2002, a new infectious disease was found in the southern part of china which had high mortality and morbidity and was termed ''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' (sars). it affected 8096 people and led 774 patients to death around the world, within a very short span of time [1] . several studies have shown that sars is caused by a new member of the coronavirus family. the sars coronavirus (sars-cov) was supposed to be transmitted from wild animals [2] [3] [4] . this hypothesis was then supported by the identification of a sars-cov-like virus in civet cats, sold in markets in south china. this isolate had more than 99% sequence identity with sars-cov, indicating that the virus was recently transferred from animals to human beings [5] . however, according to a recent report there is no direct evidence that the civet cat virus is the origin of the sars-cov [6] . although unlikely, the possibility that sars-cov positive animals were infected from humans cannot be formally excluded, and it was indeed reported that sars-cov was transmitted from man to pig [7] . the mechanism how the pathogen broke the barrier between its natural reservoir and man is still unclear [8] .

(ii) mers-cov could be transmitted from humans to camels, which means that humans serve as a source of mers-cov for camels. the role of camels in generating and maintaining mers-cov diversity has been repeatedly emphasized [1] . if human-to-camel transmission occurs, it requires us to refine our concept of the definition of a 'breeding ground' for mers-cov, which has important practical implications for developing vaccination strategies and control measures.

combination therapy with pyrimethamine at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours may help the prognosis. 14 supportive care such as oxygen therapy maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is also important. successful treatment of clinical feline toxoplasmosis has been described infrequently. 14, 59, 143 heartworm despite prevalence studies demonstrating a worldwide distribution and recognizing heartworm infection in up to 18% of cats tested,* the prevalence rate being approximately 5% to 10% of that found in dogs, 84, 150, 153 * references 31, 71, 84, 107, 138, 150, 151, 155, 158, 197, 269, 285. prevalence being found similar to that of fiv and felv infection, 150, 151, 158 feline heartworm disease remains underdiagnosed in general practice. 30, 195 this is likely because clinical signs vary dramatically from no signs to sudden death and definitive diagnosis can be difficult. 20, 30, 153, 196 heartworm disease is caused by the filarioid nematode dirofilaria immitis, which is transmitted by mosquitos and for which dogs are the usual definitive host. therefore a prerequisite for heartworm infection is a climate with adequate temperature and humidity to support a viable mosquito population and allow maturation of larvae within the intermediate host. the sexually dimorphic adult heartworm mate within an infected dog's pulmonary artery, producing immature forms called microfilariae. circulating microfilariae are ingested by mosquitoes feeding on infected dogs. within mosquitoes, microfilariae transform into larval stages. there are five larval stages (l1 to l5); l1 to l3 transformations occur within the mosquito, and l3 is the form that is transmitted from mosquitos to dogs and cats. maturation from l3 to other larval stages occurs in subcutaneous tissues and peripheral veins of mammalian hosts; immature worms in peripheral veins are carried in the bloodstream to and through the heart, with adult heartworms ultimately residing at the caudal pulmonary arteries. 1 there are significant differences between feline and canine heartworm disease because the parasite is only partially adapted to the cat. the cat is susceptible to heartworm infection but more resistant than the dog. the cat represents a dead-end host because it cannot act as a reservoir for infection. the prepatent period in the cat is 7 to 8 months (1 to 2 months longer than in dogs). 169 in dogs, most juvenile worms mature into adults that can live for 5 to 7 years, whereas in cats most juvenile worms die shortly after arriving in the pulmonary arteries, instigating a severe vascular and parenchymal inflammatory response. pulmonary lesions may be long lasting. the clinical response in the cat has been termed heartworm-associated respiratory disease (hard). in a small percentage of cats, a few worms develop to mature adults that can live for 2 to 3 years. 195 cats with adult heartworms develop pulmonary changes characterized by intimal proliferation, eosinophilic endarteritis, intimal fibrosis, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. arterial wall changes can lead to pulmonary hypertension with resultant pulmonary arterial distention. 173 damage can be caused by juvenile heartworms without development to the adult stage, resulting in increase in thickness of the pulmonary arterial wall that in turn causes occlusion. 26, 56 there have been suggestions that wolbachia pipientis, a symbiotic gram-negative intracellular bacterium harbored by d. immitis induces further pulmonary pathology. 57 a strong antibody response against wolbachia surface protein has american heartworm society, the primary reasons for heartworm testing in cats are as follows:

(fig. 1 ). an example of a serious and widespread bacterial infection is mosquito-transmitted plasmodium falciparum, causing malaria in many tropical regions. malaria causes significant morbidity and co-morbidity in these regions in which it is endemic. due to the complex life cycle of the causative bacterium, it has been challenging to achieve a vaccine for malaria. the most advanced candidate is the rts,s/as01 vaccine [18] , which is undergoing a pilot implementation in three countries in sub-saharan africa, with a view to determining its impact on disease prior to a wider implementation [19] . despite the availability of approved vaccines [20, 21] , typhoid fever and cholera remain significantly debilitating enteric diseases in regions of the world where hygienic living conditions are poor and there is little access to health care. both infections are caused by bacteria (salmonella typhi and vibrio cholera, respectively) which exist in contaminated water and food. tuberculosis (tb) is a respiratory infection which is widespread globally. caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, and transmitted to man from zoonotic reservoirs (badgers, cattle) with a high potential for subsequent human-to-human transmission, tb is prevalent in susceptible individuals living in overcrowded conditions [22] . although the bcg vaccine has been in routine use for many years, variable efficacy has been reported, depending on region of use [23, 24] with 60-80% reported in the united kingdom but lower levels in equatorial countries. the emergence of multi-drugresistant tb (mdr tb) in recent years raises the bar for treatment of this disease and makes a high level of vaccine efficacy even more important [25] . examples of zoonotic reservoirs which maintain endemic viral diseases are numerous and are summarized in table 3 . in particular, viral endemic disease is caused by the coronaviruses (mers and sars) in saudi arabia and the eastern mediterranean countries; and by the lassa arenavirus, which is endemic in west african countries and caused a serious outbreak of lassa fever in nigeria in 2018 [26] ; other viruses which are endemic and cause viral haemorrhagic fever include dengue, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide [27] , the filoviruses (ebola and marburg) which have a zoonotic reservoir in bats in sub-saharan africa [28] ; and yellow fever virus, which is prevalent in africa, central and south america and the caribbean [29] . interestingly, the same mosquito (aedes aegypti) which spreads yellow fever virus also transmits the dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses [30] . chikungunya virus has a widespread distribution in africa, asia, india and south america and with occasional cases in europe, and causes a debilitating, but rarely fatal, disease [31] . zika virus emerged in brazil in 2015 [32] , although it was first detected in monkeys in uganda as early as 1947 [33] , and the first documented human case occurred in nigeria in 1954 [34] . the large brazilian outbreak of zika viral disease culminated in 2017, with thousands of cases reported [35] . rift valley fever virus (rvfv) is another zoonotic virus which is endemic in sub-saharan africa and primarily infects cattle, sheep and goats, but can be transmitted to man by mosquito bite to cause an acute fever [36] . an example of a bacterium which has been classed as a re-emerging pathogen and which is endemic in global regions is y. pestis, causative of plague. bubonic [37] [38] [39] . over thousands of years, y. pestis has evolved away from the enteric yersinia species to become a lethal flea-transmitted bacterium [40] . it is transmitted to man, typically from a zoonotic reservoir in infected rats or other rodents (e.g. ground squirrels or prairie dogs), by flea-bite to cause bubonic plague [41] (fig. 2 ). if not detected and treated, this can develop into either septicemic plague or the most serious form of all, a secondary pneumonic plague. in turn, individuals with pneumonic plague can transmit this by aerosol droplet to others, to establish a primary pneumonic plague infection. each year, a few cases of plague are also reported in the southwestern united states, where the disease has been endemic in the rodent population since the late 1800s [42] . as well as infecting the rodent population, infected fleas can spread y. pestis to other wildlife species (e.g. rabbits/hares or, rarely, domesticated animals [43] ) which, in turn, raises the potential of transmission to man by inhalation to cause a primary pneumonic plague. in endemic areas, outbreaks of plague are often associated with seasonal environmental changes, causing rodents to stray closer to human habitation. the plague outbreak in madagascar during 2017/18 was particularly serious, with an estimated 2671 cases and 239 deaths (8·9% fatality rate) [44] . this outbreak was approximately sixfold greater than usual, with an unusual predominance of pneumonic, rather than bubonic plague.

[7] [8] [9] as such, deer-proof fencing, introduction of guinea fowl, and the use of molluscicides can minimize transmission. removal of organic matter, in the form of leaf or wood piles, and establishment of pasture perimeters using limestone or gravel also inhibits snail and slug habitation in camelid pastures. 10 more complete assessments of parasite control measures are covered in the articles ''gastrointestinal parasitology'' by ballweber and ''neurological diseases'' by whitehead and bedenice elsewhere in this issue.
