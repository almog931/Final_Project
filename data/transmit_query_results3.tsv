According to the most recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), and B viruses cocirculated and caused outbreaks worldwide between September 2004 and August 2005. Although most of the outbreaks (regional or widespread) were associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses, influenza B viruses circulated widely and caused outbreaks in some countries in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, Oceania, and South America. Influenza A(H1) viruses circulated to a lesser extent and caused outbreaks in a few countries in Africa, central Asia, and eastern Europe. 9 Human influenza is extremely contagious and is transmitted from person to person, usually by the airborne route. In nursing homes, up to 60% of patients can develop disease. Infected persons are most contagious during the period of peak symptoms. The attack rate in children is 14% to 40% yearly and more than 30% in preschool age children. Children frequently infect their families. In the United States, annual averages of 94 735 (range, 18 908-193 561) primary and 133 900 (30 757-271 529) bany listed pneumonia and influenza hospitalizationsQ were associated with influenza virus infections. Annual averages of 226 054 (54 523-430 960) primary and 294 128 (86 494-544 909) bany listed respiratory and circulatory hospitalizationsQ were associated with influenza virus infections. Significant numbers of influenzaassociated hospitalizations in the United States occur among the elderly, and the numbers of these hospitalizations have increased substantially over the last 2 decades due in part to the aging of the population. Influenza-associated hospitali-zation rates increased annually from 1979-1980 to 2000-2001 among persons aged 50 through 85 years and older. 10 Influenza and pneumonia comprise the sixth leading cause of death in the United States overall and the fifth leading cause among adults 65 years and older. In the 1990s, influenza-related deaths increased to about 36 000 per year. The number of deaths can increase to 40 000 during epidemics. 11 In economically developed countries, mortality increases distinctly during winter months. A study analyzed monthly the mortality in the United States during the period 1959 to 1999 for 4 major disease classes. The authors isolated the seasonal component of mortality by removing trends and standardizing the time series. Peak months of mortality for ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus coincided appropriately with peaks in pneumonia and influenza. The magnitude of the seasonal component was highly correlated with traditional measures of excess mortality and was significantly larger in seasons dominated by influenza A(H2N2) and A(H3N2) viruses than in seasons dominated by A(H1N1) or B viruses. There was an age shift in mortality during and after the 1968 or 1969 pandemic in each disease class, with features specific to influenza A(H3N2). These findings suggest that the cause of the winter increase in US mortality is singular and probably influenza. Weather and other factors may determine the timing and modulate the magnitude of the winter-season increase in mortality, but the primary determinant appears to be the influenza virus. 12 Observational studies reported that influenza vaccination reduces winter mortality risk from any cause by 50% among the elderly. A study by Simonsen et al 13 could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group. They showed that for people aged 65 to 74 years, excess mortality rates in A(H3N2)-dominated seasons fell between 1968 and the early 1980s but remained approximately constant thereafter. For persons 85 years or older, the mortality rate remained flat throughout. Excess mortality in A(H1N1) and B seasons did not change. All-cause excess mortality for persons 65 years or older never exceeded 10% of all winter deaths. The authors attributed the decline in influenza-related mortality among people aged 65 to 74 years in the decade after the 1968 pandemic to the acquisition of immunity to the emerging A(H3N2) virus. They concluded that observational studies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit. 13 The study has provoked starkly different reactions and certainly indicates that there is room for improvement of influenza vaccines. 14 A statement by CDC and National Institutes of Health clarifies that the Simonsen study in no way implies that the elderly should not receive influenza vaccine. Rather, the study concludes that the vaccine may prevent fewer deaths among the elderly than previous studies would have suggested. Vaccination remains the best available protection from influenza for people 65 years and older. It may be beneficial to vaccinate larger numbers of healthy persons, including children, to prevent transmission of influenza viruses to high-risk persons such as the elderly (CDC.

ISG15 plays a role in resistance to Ebola virus (also VSV and rabies virus) by blocking the activity of Nedd4 via ISGylation (reviewed in Sadler and Williams, 2008) . ISG15 blocks the interaction of Nedd4 with its E2, preventing transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to Nedd4 (Malakhova and Zhang, 2008) . The ubiquitination of HIV-1 Gag and Tsg101 and Nedd4 are necessary for virion budding and release from the cell surface as discussed earlier. Type I IFN inhibits the assembly and release of HIV-1 virions. This occurs through the IFN-induced expression of ISG15, which inhibits the ubiquitination of Gag and Tsg101, preventing the interaction of the Gag L domain with Tsg101 . However, ISG15 is not itself conjugated to Gag or Tsg101. Ubiquitination of Gag by the Nedd4 ubiquitin ligase is necessary for the release of virions. Overexpression of ISG15 effectively decreases the ability of Nedd4 to ubiquitinate the viral matrix proteins (VP40), thereby decreasing release of Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) from cells (Okumura et al., 2008) . Other Ubiquitin-like Modifiers: Urm-1 The role of ubiquitin-like modifiers is no longer confined to the modification of proteins and lipids. A recent series of papers describes an unexpected role for ubiquitin-related molecule-1 (Urm-1) in transfer RNA (tRNA) modification (Schlieker et al., 2008; Leidel et al., 2009; Noma et al., 2009) . Though only distantly related to ubiquitin, Urm-1 has the typical b-grasp fold that characterizes members of the ubiquitin family (Singh et al., 2005) and also possesses the typical diglycine motif at the C terminus of the mature polypeptide, common to ubiquitin and ubiquitinlike modifiers. The occurrence of proteins covalently modified by Urm-1 (''urmylation'') has been reported (Furukawa et al., 2000) , but thus far appears to be limited to a single protein of known identity, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (Ahp1), in yeast (Goehring et al., 2003) . Whether urmylation of proteins is a widespread modification, and if so, under which conditions (stress, growth conditions, and virus infection) remain open questions. Urm-1 serves as a sulfur carrier essential for thiolation of certain tRNAs [(UUU) Lys; (UUC) Glu; and (UUG) Gln], which carry a thiolated uridine residue in the wobble position of the anticodon (Schlieker et al., 2008; Leidel et al., 2009; Noma et al., 2009) . Urm-1 can be isolated from mammalian cells as a C-terminal thiocarboxylate that is the immediate precursor for a sulfur transfer reaction involving a persulfidic intermediate (Schlieker et al., 2008) . In the absence of Urm-1, yeast cells can no longer carry out the requisite thiolation reaction and become sensitive to a variety of stresses (Pedrioli et al., 2008) . The mechanistic link between a failure to execute thiolation and the increased sensi-tivity to stress observed in Urm-deficient cells is not yet understood. For example, it is not clear how tRNAs that fail to undergo thiolation affect translational efficiency, fidelity, or the half-lives of the tRNAs themselves. A number of plant viruses, including brome mosaic virus, possess tRNA-like structures at the 3 0 end of their genomes. These structures are suffciently similar to tRNAs to serve as substrates for aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and other enzymes that act on tRNAs (Dreher, 2009) . The mouse gammaherpesvirus MHV-68 encodes at least eight tRNA-like sequences that can be processed into mature uncharged tRNAs, the function of which in the context of the virus life cycle is obscure. Clearly, viruses have co-opted tRNAs and tRNA-like structures to initiate replication, as is well established for retroviruses (reviewed in Abbink and Berkhout, 2008) , presumably for reasons that increase fitness, but we still lack an adequate mechanistic explanation. Given the relationship between Urm-1 and specific tRNA modifications, it is perhaps reasonable to suggest that aspects of translational control and fidelity, as well as virus replication itself, may be modified in a manner that involves Urm-1, although for the moment this remains pure speculation.

A key feature of a potentially pandemic influenza virus is its ability to spread efficiently from infected to noninfected hosts (ie, its transmissibility). The molecular basis of influenza virus transmissibility remains unresolved. 15 Like the 1918 virus, H5N1 influenza has unusually high virulence. Although the 2 viruses differ in their transmissibility among humans, there is concern that currently circulating H5N1 viruses will evolve into a pandemic strain by adapting to humans through genetic mutation or reassortment with human influenza strains. Fortunately, there has been no direct evidence of efficient poultryto-human or human-to-human transmission to date. 16 Nevertheless, probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A(H5N1) was reported. The index patient was an 11-year-old girl who lived with her aunt. She became ill 3 to 4 days after her last exposure to dying household chickens. Her mother came from a distant city to care for her in the hospital, had no recognized exposure to poultry, and died from pneumonia after providing 16 to 18 hours of unprotected nursing care. The aunt also provided unprotected nursing care; she had fever 5 days after the mother first had fever, followed by pneumonia 7 days later. Autopsy tissue from the mother and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs from the aunt were positive for influenza A(H5N1) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. No additional chains of transmission were identified, and sequencing of the viral genes identified no change in the receptorbinding site of hemagglutinin or other key features of the virus. The sequences of all 8 viral gene segments clustered closely with other H5N1 sequences from recent avian isolates in Thailand. It was concluded that the disease in the mother and aunt probably resulted from person-to-person transmission of this lethal avian influenza virus during unprotected exposure to the critically ill index patient. 17, 18 However, a study from Vietnam showed a lack of H5N1 avian influenza transmission to hospital employees. 19 The incubation period in the reported cases seemed to be 2 to 4 days, similar to that in cases of human influenza, followed in most patients by fever, cough, and dyspnea. Diarrhea was variably reported, and sore throat and runny nose were noted in some of the patients. A striking feature was marked lymphopenia in those patients who were severely ill. Unlike cases of human influenza, in the H5N1 avian virus cases, primary viral pneumonia was common, whereas secondary bacterial pneumonia has not been reported. 20 An epidemic of avian influenza A(H7N7) occurred in The Netherlands in 2003, which affected 255 flocks and led to the culling of 30 million birds. To evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures, a study quantified between-flock transmission characteristics of the virus in 2 affected areas. The control measures markedly reduced the transmission of the virus. The study suggests that the containment of the epidemic was probably due to the reduction in the number of susceptible flocks by complete depopulation of the infected areas rather than to the reduction of the transmission by the other control measures. 21 A recent report described the occurrence of infection with the virus in household contacts of human index cases, in the absence of contact with infected poultry, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus during the 2003 poultry epidemic. 22, 23 In 2004, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) occurred in poultry in British Columbia, Canada. Surveillance identified 2 persons with confirmed avian influenza infection. Symptoms included conjunctivitis and mild influenza-like illness. 24 Why is H5N1 of particular concern? Of the avian influenza virus subtypes, H5N1 is of particular concern for several reasons. It mutates rapidly and has a known propensity to acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species. Its ability to cause severe disease in humans has now been documented. In addition, laboratory studies have demonstrated that isolates of this virus have a high pathogenicity and can cause severe disease in humans. Birds that survive infection excrete virus for at least 10 days, orally and in feces, thus, facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by migratory birds. H5N1 variants demonstrated a capacity to directly infect humans in 1997, and have done so again in Vietnam and other countries since 2003. The spread of infection in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans. If more humans become infected over time, the likelihood also increases that humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influ-enza strains, could serve as the bmixing vesselQ for the emergence of a novel subtype with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic. 2 The last century saw pandemic influenza viruses belonging to 3 subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) , and indirect evidence suggests that H3 viruses were circulating from 1889 to 1918 and that H1 viruses were possibly prevalent before 1889. If this series of events over the last hundred years reflects a pattern, recycling of subtypes would be the norm in the human population, and the possibility for the emergence of new pandemics would be limited. On the other hand, if any subtype is able to thrive in the human population, a greater number of possibilities for novel pandemic strains would exist. Although H5N1 avian viruses were shown to cause death in humans, none of these strains were easily transmitted from human to human. Also, none of the H5N1 strains showed evidence of having acquired genes from circulating human influenza viruses. Whether this is a necessary requirement for a pandemic strain to be successful is not known. It would seem probable that such a reassortment event between an avian and a human influenza virus could have happened many times over, either in humans or in animals. It may be possible that infections of humans by avian influenza viruses have been ongoing for decades, and it is only the reporting that has improved in recent years. If this were the case, the present emphasis on the imminent pandemic outbreak would not be justified. 25 However, the precursor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus has been shown to have repeatedly crossed species barriers, probably for many years, before it finally acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission, and its pathogenicity to humans was not attenuated. 26 Because the H5N1 virus continues to evolve and spread, with additional human infections occurring in many countries, we cannot afford simply to hope that human-to-human spread of the virus does not happen, and that if it does, the pathogenicity of the virus will attenuate. 8 What is warranted and where there is little or no disagreement among scientists is a continued surveillance of influenza viruses. Stockpiling of antiviral drugs and the development of new vaccines are highly recommended to be better prepared for a potential pandemic outbreak. 25 Recent advances in recombinant technologies have shown the possibility of constructing premade libraries of vaccine strains, so that adequate preparations can be made for epidemics and pandemics. 27 Cross-protection against multiple influenza A subtypes can be induced in animals by prior infection or vaccination. Multiple viral antigens and multiple immune effector mechanisms can participate. Mucosal vaccination induces different immune responses than systemic vaccination and is more effective at inducing broad cross-protection to multiple influenza A subtypes in animals. Broad cross-protection in humans is of unclear potency and duration, but epidemiological data suggest that it may have an impact. A variety of vaccines may induce broad cross-protection if administered appropriately. Imperfect vaccine protection is worth having, especially for a virus causing an acute (not latent) infection. It could provide a first line of pandemic defense to be augmented by subtype-or strain-specific vaccines when available. 28 More recent articles also reviewed and discussed the development of cross-protective vaccines. [29] [30] [31] [32] Both adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) were believed to be effective against a pandemic virus, although emergence of resistance has apparently occurred with adamantanes, and the more recent type A(H5N1) virus as well as some currently circulating seasonal viruses are not susceptible to this drug class. 30 A recent study showed that stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors that cover 20% to 25% of the population would be sufficient to treat most of the clinical cases and could lead to 50% to 77% reduction in hospitalizations. 33 Another study indicated that current stockpiling of oseltamivir appears to be cost saving under several treatment strategies, including therapeutic treatment of patients and postexposure prophylactic treatment of patients' close contacts. 34 In addition, antimicrobial agents can help control secondary bacterial infections, which could have been the cause of death among many patients during the 1918 pandemic. 6 In view of the threat of a potentially serious influenza pandemic, many governments have drafted pandemic influenza preparedness and response plans. The US draft plan was posted in August 2004. The plan stressed the need for improved measures to safeguard the public. In particular, steps need to be taken in the areas of surveillance, vaccine development and production, antiviral stockpiling, research, and public health preparedness. A key part of the plan is to establish public safety measures and coordination with state and local levels. 35 The formal plan was launched by the Department of Health and Human Services (Washington, DC) in November 2005 (www.dhhs. gov/pandemicflu/plan/). On April 1, 2005, the US government issued a directive allowing authorities to detain or isolate any passenger suspected of having avian influenza when arriving in the United States aboard an international flight. Under the directive, the Health and Human Services Department is given legal authority to detain or isolate any passenger suspected of having avian influenza to prevent the person from infecting others (Reuters, April 1, 2005) .

The index patient was an 11-year-old girl who lived with her aunt. She became ill 3 to 4 days after her last exposure to dying household chickens. Her mother came from a distant city to care for her in the hospital, had no recognized exposure to poultry, and died from pneumonia after providing 16 to 18 hours of unprotected nursing care. The aunt also provided unprotected nursing care; she had fever 5 days after the mother first had fever, followed by pneumonia 7 days later. Autopsy tissue from the mother and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs from the aunt were positive for influenza A(H5N1) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. No additional chains of transmission were identified, and sequencing of the viral genes identified no change in the receptorbinding site of hemagglutinin or other key features of the virus. The sequences of all 8 viral gene segments clustered closely with other H5N1 sequences from recent avian isolates in Thailand. It was concluded that the disease in the mother and aunt probably resulted from person-to-person transmission of this lethal avian influenza virus during unprotected exposure to the critically ill index patient. 17, 18 However, a study from Vietnam showed a lack of H5N1 avian influenza transmission to hospital employees. 19 The incubation period in the reported cases seemed to be 2 to 4 days, similar to that in cases of human influenza, followed in most patients by fever, cough, and dyspnea. Diarrhea was variably reported, and sore throat and runny nose were noted in some of the patients. A striking feature was marked lymphopenia in those patients who were severely ill. Unlike cases of human influenza, in the H5N1 avian virus cases, primary viral pneumonia was common, whereas secondary bacterial pneumonia has not been reported. 20 An epidemic of avian influenza A(H7N7) occurred in The Netherlands in 2003, which affected 255 flocks and led to the culling of 30 million birds. To evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures, a study quantified between-flock transmission characteristics of the virus in 2 affected areas. The control measures markedly reduced the transmission of the virus. The study suggests that the containment of the epidemic was probably due to the reduction in the number of susceptible flocks by complete depopulation of the infected areas rather than to the reduction of the transmission by the other control measures. 21 A recent report described the occurrence of infection with the virus in household contacts of human index cases, in the absence of contact with infected poultry, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus during the 2003 poultry epidemic. 22, 23 In 2004, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) occurred in poultry in British Columbia, Canada. Surveillance identified 2 persons with confirmed avian influenza infection. Symptoms included conjunctivitis and mild influenza-like illness. 24 Why is H5N1 of particular concern? Of the avian influenza virus subtypes, H5N1 is of particular concern for several reasons. It mutates rapidly and has a known propensity to acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species. Its ability to cause severe disease in humans has now been documented. In addition, laboratory studies have demonstrated that isolates of this virus have a high pathogenicity and can cause severe disease in humans. Birds that survive infection excrete virus for at least 10 days, orally and in feces, thus, facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by migratory birds. H5N1 variants demonstrated a capacity to directly infect humans in 1997, and have done so again in Vietnam and other countries since 2003. The spread of infection in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans. If more humans become infected over time, the likelihood also increases that humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influ-enza strains, could serve as the bmixing vesselQ for the emergence of a novel subtype with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic. 2 The last century saw pandemic influenza viruses belonging to 3 subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) , and indirect evidence suggests that H3 viruses were circulating from 1889 to 1918 and that H1 viruses were possibly prevalent before 1889. If this series of events over the last hundred years reflects a pattern, recycling of subtypes would be the norm in the human population, and the possibility for the emergence of new pandemics would be limited. On the other hand, if any subtype is able to thrive in the human population, a greater number of possibilities for novel pandemic strains would exist. Although H5N1 avian viruses were shown to cause death in humans, none of these strains were easily transmitted from human to human. Also, none of the H5N1 strains showed evidence of having acquired genes from circulating human influenza viruses. Whether this is a necessary requirement for a pandemic strain to be successful is not known. It would seem probable that such a reassortment event between an avian and a human influenza virus could have happened many times over, either in humans or in animals. It may be possible that infections of humans by avian influenza viruses have been ongoing for decades, and it is only the reporting that has improved in recent years. If this were the case, the present emphasis on the imminent pandemic outbreak would not be justified. 25 However, the precursor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus has been shown to have repeatedly crossed species barriers, probably for many years, before it finally acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission, and its pathogenicity to humans was not attenuated. 26 Because the H5N1 virus continues to evolve and spread, with additional human infections occurring in many countries, we cannot afford simply to hope that human-to-human spread of the virus does not happen, and that if it does, the pathogenicity of the virus will attenuate. 8 What is warranted and where there is little or no disagreement among scientists is a continued surveillance of influenza viruses. Stockpiling of antiviral drugs and the development of new vaccines are highly recommended to be better prepared for a potential pandemic outbreak. 25 Recent advances in recombinant technologies have shown the possibility of constructing premade libraries of vaccine strains, so that adequate preparations can be made for epidemics and pandemics. 27 Cross-protection against multiple influenza A subtypes can be induced in animals by prior infection or vaccination. Multiple viral antigens and multiple immune effector mechanisms can participate. Mucosal vaccination induces different immune responses than systemic vaccination and is more effective at inducing broad cross-protection to multiple influenza A subtypes in animals. Broad cross-protection in humans is of unclear potency and duration, but epidemiological data suggest that it may have an impact. A variety of vaccines may induce broad cross-protection if administered appropriately. Imperfect vaccine protection is worth having, especially for a virus causing an acute (not latent) infection. It could provide a first line of pandemic defense to be augmented by subtype-or strain-specific vaccines when available. 28 More recent articles also reviewed and discussed the development of cross-protective vaccines. [29] [30] [31] [32] Both adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) were believed to be effective against a pandemic virus, although emergence of resistance has apparently occurred with adamantanes, and the more recent type A(H5N1) virus as well as some currently circulating seasonal viruses are not susceptible to this drug class. 30 A recent study showed that stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors that cover 20% to 25% of the population would be sufficient to treat most of the clinical cases and could lead to 50% to 77% reduction in hospitalizations. 33 Another study indicated that current stockpiling of oseltamivir appears to be cost saving under several treatment strategies, including therapeutic treatment of patients and postexposure prophylactic treatment of patients' close contacts. 34 In addition, antimicrobial agents can help control secondary bacterial infections, which could have been the cause of death among many patients during the 1918 pandemic. 6 In view of the threat of a potentially serious influenza pandemic, many governments have drafted pandemic influenza preparedness and response plans. The US draft plan was posted in August 2004. The plan stressed the need for improved measures to safeguard the public. In particular, steps need to be taken in the areas of surveillance, vaccine development and production, antiviral stockpiling, research, and public health preparedness. A key part of the plan is to establish public safety measures and coordination with state and local levels. 35 The formal plan was launched by the Department of Health and Human Services (Washington, DC) in November 2005 (www.dhhs. gov/pandemicflu/plan/). On April 1, 2005, the US government issued a directive allowing authorities to detain or isolate any passenger suspected of having avian influenza when arriving in the United States aboard an international flight. Under the directive, the Health and Human Services Department is given legal authority to detain or isolate any passenger suspected of having avian influenza to prevent the person from infecting others (Reuters, April 1, 2005) .

Because emergence of new and destructive pathogens is so unpredictable, surveillance is the first line of defense in the broad-scale detection and containment of outbreaks. 68 Surveillance is performed at many levels, from the local community to global agencies. In addition to formal methods of surveillance by public health agencies at all levels of government, alternative forms of surveillance can provide early clues to the beginning of disease outbreaks. Sudden increases in rumors via Internet bulletin boards or cellular phone text messages were noted in the early stages of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 69 (a deadly respiratory infection that emerged from Asia in 2003 that is caused by a coronavirus and characterized by fever, diarrhea, and pneumonia 70 ). Formal electronic communication between infection control professionals has enhanced surveillance efforts. 71 Social distancing refers to physical separation of infectious and high-risk individuals from other susceptible individuals in the hope of controlling the spread of disease by reducing person-to-person contact. Social distancing on a global scale may entail curtailing air travel to prevent illnesses from "hopscotching" across large areas. For example, the 2003 outbreak of SARS originated in China and spread to Hong Kong and ultimately to 22 countries, in part, as a result of air travel. 72 Five international commercial airliners were linked to the spread of SARS from infected passengers to fellow passengers and airline crew. 73 A 1979 cluster of influenza A aboard a commercial aircraft was documented in which 72% of passengers had contracted the same viral strain. 20 Efforts to limit air travel, however, would require the isolation of many larger airports 74 and consistent adherence to advice that symptomatic passengers postpone travel or seek medical advice if they have flu symptoms. 75 The decrease in airline travel after the September 11, 2001, attacks provided an opportunity to observe a change in the spread of influenza resulting from altered travel patterns. The influenza season that year was delayed and smaller presumably because fewer travelers translated into fewer opportunities to disseminate flu across the country. 76 Mathematical models have been devised to predict the onset of peak incidence of influenza during an epidemic or pandemic as well as the role of air travel in spreading disease. Models suggest that air travel does add to the number of predicted cases of influenza across the nation, and such models can also help characterize an epidemic once it has started. 76 Another model suggests that if an influenza strain is highly transmissible (similar to the spread of SARS), a global outbreak could quickly spread if even a few infected individuals were allowed to travel to just 3 major destination cities. Isolating the top 2% most populous cities from the normal influx of visitors could cut the need to vaccinate by almost one half. 74 Community-level social distancing would be aimed at decreasing person-to-person contact. This could include steps such as canceling large-scale events and encouraging workplace strategies to decrease person-to-person contact, such as working remotely from home, teleconferencing, and increasing physical distance of workstations. 77 It is widely accepted that young children most easily transmit the virus. This is attributable to the observations that: (1) children experience a large number of contacts with other children in school or daycare, (2) children are assumed to be more susceptible because of lower immune status, and (3) children could be more infectious because they shed more virus and shed the virus for a longer time period compared with older individuals. 59 Modeling of social contacts suggests that teenagers may also substantially increase the spread of influenza. 78 Because children (especially preschoolers) are thought to play a major role in spreading influenza in the community, some social distancing strategies are directed specifically at children, including closure of schools and daycare facilities. One study estimates more than 40% of secondary flu cases are attributable to exposure to a sick preschool child. The effectiveness of social distancing targeting children is demonstrated by a study showing that the proportion of sick children decreased sharply once winter school recess commenced. The entire profile of this epidemic changed abruptly as a result of interrupting the cycle of infection by sending children home for the holidays. 79 Such a strategy is not foolproof, however, because some benefits could be negated by increased spread of illness in the home or neighborhood when school is canceled. Even with school closures, preventing contact with nonhousehold children markedly increased the efficacy of social distancing. 78 In the event of a pandemic outbreak of the flu, the multitude of persons expected to become ill will likely overwhelm hospitals and other health care facilities. This challenge of so-called "surge capacity" is a concern for clinic administrators and planners at the community public health level. Efforts are being made to increase surge capacity to meet the unprecedented demand for care anticipated during a pandemic. Measures include identification of temporary clinical care areas on the premises of health care facilities or makeshift patient wards in large structures (e.g., aircraft hangars, recreation centers, churches), predetermined procedures to facilitate and monitor home care, and caching of specific supplies. 80 Surge capacity also can be enhanced by restricting elective surgeries to free up beds and personnel. 81 Benefits of using various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic control measures would be (1) a lower total number of cases of illness (versus no interventions), (2) a dampening of the peak number of cases during each outbreak, and (3) spreading out the number of sick patients over a longer time interval. 79, 82 Flattening and extending the pattern of an epi-demic or pandemic will make the outbreak more manageable and less overwhelming at any given point in time.

Here we use publicly-available mobility data and a stochastic branching process model to evaluate the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to limiting the spread of COVID-19 from Wuhan to other cities in mainland China, while accounting for underreporting and uncertainty. We find that although travel restrictions led to a significant decrease in the number of individuals leaving Wuhan during the busy post-Lunar New Year holiday travel period, local transmission was likely already established in major cities. Thus, the travel restrictions likely did not affect the epidemic trajectory substantially in these cities.

SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus with high nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses detected in horseshoe bats, has spread across the world and impacted global healthcare systems and economy1,2. A suitable small animal model is needed to support vaccine and therapy development. We report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells, and in areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 post-inoculation (dpi), followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia on 7 dpi. Viral antigen was also found in the duodenum epithelial cells with viral RNA detected in feces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naïve hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in humans with mild infections.

T he ability of coronaviruses (CoVs) to infect multiple species and to rapidly change through recombination presents a continuing human health threat. The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2003-2004 during which a CoV transmitted from bats to civet cats and then to humans demonstrated this potential (reviewed in [1, 2] ). Recently, a novel human betacoronavirus (betaCoV) was found to be associated with at least 13 human infections, 7 of which were fatal (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . One of the viruses, EMC/2012, has been sequenced, and its sequence similarity to several bat CoVs suggested an animal origin, but a definitive bat species of origin has not yet been identified (3) . Additional genome sequences from this virus are needed to aid diagnostics, monitor population dynamics, identify the animal source, and characterize mechanisms of pathogenesis. The large size (30,000 nt) and high variability of CoV RNA genomes present a challenge for sequencing.

Case-patients in our study were significantly more likely than controls to report diabetes; this finding provides epidemiologic evidence of diabetes as a risk factor for MERS-CoV illness. Smoking and heart disease were also significantly associated with MERS-CoV illness. Of note was the overwhelming male preponderance in our study; only 1 of the 30 case-patients with primary infection was female. The fact that men in Saudi Arabia are much more likely than women to have contact with dromedaries might explain this observation. Previous studies have reported some male preponderance, but those findings were not as striking as our results, probably because MERS-CoV infections in most patients in other studies were healthcare associated and transmitted from human to human (2, 4) Our study is subject to several limitations. First, the delay between illness and interview might have affected recall among study participants. Second, our study was a nationwide investigation that covered a large area, and interviews were conducted by different teams at different times. However, all interviewers received training designed to limit interview variability. Third, MERS-CoV is a highly lethal disease, and 17 of the 30 case-patients in our study were interviewed by proxy (i.e., information was collected from a family member), which might have affected the reliability of the exposure information collected. Fourth, choosing neighborhood controls could have resulted in an underestimation of certain risk factors because of possible similarities between case-patients and controls. However, the study still identified an association with dromedary exposure. Fifth, the occurrence of primary MERS-CoV cases is a relatively rare event, limiting the number of cases available for inclusion in our study and the power to detect differences from controls. We applied stringent criteria for enrollment and attempted to exclude persons who might have acquired infection through human-to-human transmission, but the possibility of misclassification remains. However, inadvertent inclusion of secondary cases is likely to mean that the true risk associated with dromedary exposure was higher than we estimated. Sixth, we did not investigate dromedary husbandry practices or ascertain whether dromedaries were infected with MERS-CoV. Additionally, the surveillance system in place in Saudi Arabia might be more likely to detect persons severely affected by MERS-CoV, who also might be more likely to have underlying conditions. This fact might have overstated the role of underlying conditions as a risk factor for disease. Finally, as in any study where a large number of parameters are tested, the expected type 1 error rate is 5%; therefore, one could anticipate that 1 in 20 significant results would incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.

A newly enteric coronavirus, PDCoV, was identified in the USA in 2014, and this coronavirus caused clinical signs in swine similar to those of PEDV (Wang et al., 2014a) . In this study, a novel PEAV (PEAV-GD-CH/2017) strain was identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea, and this strain shares high identities with the other two PEAV strains that were previously reported (Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017) . These novel PEAVs are most identical to bat-HKU2, with 95% nucleotide identity, and have the same genome organization and TRS motif for each ORF. The greatest difference between PEAV and bat-HKU2 is their S proteins, which share 85% amino acid identity each other, a value much lower compared with those of other proteins (Table 1) . This difference is caused by amino acid mutations in the S protein, particularly in the NTD in the S1 subunit, which has been proven to be the key factor determining issue tropism and the host range of coronaviruses (Lu et al., 2015) . In addition to its low amino acid identity with the S protein of HKU2-like coronavirus, it shares low amino acid identity (lower than 28%) with S proteins of all known coronaviruses. Thus, clarifying the origin of the S proteins of PEAV and HKU2-like coronavirus is important for determining the origin and evolutionary history of these coronaviruses. A previous study showed that the extreme NTD in the S1 subunit of PEAV is structurally similar to that of NL63, while the rest of the S1 subunit is structurally similar to that of MHV (Pan et al., 2017) . In addition, a short peptide in the S protein of bat-HKU2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2007) . We also analyzed the arginine (position 545) at cleavage sites S1/S2 of PEAV and found that it is conserved in several beta-CoVs in this study. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree based on the S protein presents a uniform evolutionary relationship; these bat-HKU2like coronaviruses cluster with a newly identified rat-CoV, LRNV, which represents a novel species of coronaviruses. All of these strains form a distinct lineage and cluster with beta-CoVs but are separate from all four known subgroups of beta-CoVs (Fig. 3) , which may indicate that these strains are part of a novel subgroup of beta-CoVs. These results suggest that PEAV and HKU2-like coronaviruses may have some relations with beta-CoVs and most likely resulted from recombination with the backbone of alpha-CoV and the S gene from an unrecognized beta-CoV. Another large difference between PEAV and bat-HKU2 is N protein, which share about 93.9% amino acid identity, as N protein is a multifunctional protein for coronaviruses, which is involving in virus replication, budding and pathogenesis et al. (McBride et al., 2014) . While the role of these mutations in N protein between PEAV and bat-HKU2 should further investigate. The origin and emergence time of a newly emerged pathogen are important issues to answer to determine the evolutionary history and plan methods of prevention for these new pathogens. For example, previous SARS research reported that the interspecies transfer of SARSlike coronaviruses from bats to the amplifying host (e.g., civet) occurred in 1998 and that interspecies transfer from civet to humans occurred in 2002 (Chinese, 2004; Hon et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2010; Song et al., 2005) . These results provide insight into the origin and evolutionary history of SARS coronavirus. The origin and divergence time of other coronaviruses have also been estimated previously; the divergence time of bovine-CoV and HCoV-OC43 could be dated back to the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century and was estimated at 1910 (Vijgen et al., 2006) . The TMRCA for all PDCoV strains was reported at 1991, approximately 24 years before PDCoV was identified (Woo et al., 2017) . In this study, we also addressed the emergence time and evolutionary history of PEAV and of the other coronaviruses based on the RdRp gene by Bayesian analysis. In anticipation, the mean divergence time of bovine-CoV and HCoV-OC43 was estimated at 1914, and the mean TMRCA of human and civet SARSr-CoV was estimated at 2001 in our analysis (Fig. 4) . These results are highly consistent with those of a previous report discussed above and further indicate that our analysis is unbiased. The emergence time of PEAV was estimated at 1926 (95% HPD, 1864 to 1984) based on our analysis, which indicates that PEAV is not newly emerged and may have circulated in swine herds for several decades since interspecies transmission from bat to swine occurred. In addition, these HKU2-like coronaviruses have a common ancestor with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, and the divergence time was estimated at 277, which indicates that these HKU2-like coronaviruses have a long evolutionary history. The mean TMRCA for alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, and gamma-CoV, as well as those of all coronaviruses estimated in this study, were later compared with those of a previous report (Woo et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, the mean TMRCA coincides with the regions with 95% HPD to each other. The evolutionary rate of different coronaviruses was estimated previously; 4.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year was estimated for HCoV-OC43 (Vijgen et al., 2005) , and the mean evolutionary rate for group 1b coronaviruses was estimated to be 3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (Pyrc et al., 2006) . In addition, the evolutionary rate for all coronaviruses was estimated to be 1.3 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year (Woo et al., 2012) , which is estimated to be 1.93 × 10 −4 (95% HPD, 1.27 × 10 −4 to 3.57 × 10 −4 ) nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the RdRp gene in this study, and all of these results are comparable to each other.

The mechanisms for the explosive transfer of HIV infection from DCs to CD4 + T cells observed more than 10 years ago [17, 47] remained unexplained until the description of an 'infectious synapse' between infected DCs or LCs and uninfected T cells ( [21, 46, 52, 74] , reviewed in [75] ). In the field of immunology, the existence of a structured molecular architecture at the interface between T cells and APCs, termed the 'immunological synapse', is well known [76] . By analogy, a stable adhesive junction is formed between infected DCs and uninfected T cells and directed transfer of the virus captured by the DCs then takes place from the effector (infected DC) to the target cell (uninfected CD4 + T cell). The existence of an infectious synapse is not limited to DC-T cell contacts. A similar structure termed the 'virological synapse' has been observed during cell-to-cell viral transfer from infected CD4 + T cells to uninfected T cells [77, 78] . Furthermore, other pathogens, such as HTLV-1 (human T-lymphotropic virus 1) [79] and potentially severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [80] , might propagate through a similar structure.

Considering current protective equipment (most people wear masks and do not wear goggles), among suspected individuals who are at high risk of infection through the ocular surface, performing conjunctival swabs simultaneously with nasopharyngeal swabs may be an option to detect potential infection in advance. Ophthalmologists need to remain vigilant during the COVID‐19 pandemic, and further studies are needed to determine whether SARS‐CoV‐2 can be transmitted from person to person via the conjunctival route. For the general populations, based on the current evidences, masks or goggles are not obligatory, which may exacerbate the strain on the limited medical resources.

Many respiratory viral infections such as influenza and measles result in severe acute respiratory symptoms and epidemics. In the spring of 2003, an epidemic of coronavirus pneumonia spread from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and subsequently to the rest of the world. The WHO coined the acronym SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and subsequently the causative virus as SARS-CoV. In the summer of 2012, epidemic of pneumonia occurred again in Saudi Arabia which was subsequently found to be caused by another novel coronavirus. WHO coined the term MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) to denote the Middle East origin of the novel virus (MERS-CoV). In the winter of 2019, another outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China which rapidly spread globally. Yet another novel coronavirus was identified as the culprit and has been named SARS-CoV-2 due to its similarities with SARS-CoV, and the disease as coronavirus disease-2019. This overview aims to compare and contrast the similarities and differences of these three major episodes of coronavirus EP, and conclude that they are essentially the same viral respiratory syndromes caused by similar strains of coronavirus with different names. Coronaviruses have caused major epidemics and outbreaks worldwide in the last two decades. From an epidemiological perspective, they are remarkably similar in the mode of spread by droplets. Special focus is placed on the pediatric aspects, which carry less morbidity and mortality in all three entities.

Coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded positivesense RNA viruses with genomes of 25-32 kb, and the group includes the biggest known genomes among the RNA viruses [1, 2] , which infect and cause disease in a wide variety of species, including bats, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, mice, horses, whales and humans. Five types of coronaviruses are found to be circulating the human population [3] . A second coronavirus known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been recognized as the causal organism of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the Middle East and in travellers from this region about 10 years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome became epidemic [4] . The virus MERS-CoV belongs to the genus betacoronavirus [5] which is also known as novel coronavirus (nCoV). After the first report of causing human infection was published in September 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee denied the fact that MERS-CoV did not meet the criteria of becoming ''public health emergency of global concern'' in July 2013. Nevertheless it was termed ''serious and great concern'' and was also reported as a threat to the entire world. In June, 2012, for the first time virus was identified in a patient who died in Saudi Arabia after developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunctional syndrome (MODS) [6] . In same year, the first MERS disease broke out has been reported [7] . Although the name suggests that it is limited to the Middle East, the death scenario has been also reported in France, UK, Italy and Tunisia [8] . The symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Although MERS-CoV patients have primarily had respiratory disease, a number of secondary complications have also been informed, including acute renal failure, multi-organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and consumptive coagulopathy. In addition, many patients have also reported gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea [7] . As mentioned earlier, this virus has the capacity to transmit from human to human. It was also shown that MERS-CoV was capable of infecting bats and porcine cell lines in addition to human cells. These possessions would indicate a low barrier for transmission between hosts [9] [10] [11] . Recently, dipeptydyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and huh-7 cells are identified as the receptor of MERS-CoV virus entry. After entering into the cell, the virus specially modulates the innate immune response, antigen presentation and mitogen-activated protein kinase. The genome structure of MERS-CoV is similar to other coronaviruses, with the 5 0 two-thirds of the genome encoding the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) required for viral genome replication, the remaining 3 0 third of the genome encoding the structural genes that make up the virion (spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins) and four accessory genes intermingled within the structural gene region. The viral genome expression starts with the translation of two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b, which are encoded by the viral replicase gene that compromises ORF 1a and 1b. This replicase complex not only mediates genome replication but also causes transcription of nested set of subgenomic mRNA responsible for structural proteins [12, 13] . After transcribing pp1a, -1 ribosomal frame shifting is occurred to transcribe pp1b which is subsequently cleaved into 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins [12] . The downstream region of ORF1b is characterized by containing a variable number of smaller genes, always including those encoding the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins. These genes are translated from subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that form a 5 0 and 3 0 co-terminal nested set with the viral genome. Subgenomic mRNAs are composed of a common 5 0 leader sequence that is identical to the genomic 5 0 region and a variable part of the 3 0 quarter of the genome, with different sg mRNAs making different ORFs available for translation. The complement of the leader and ''body'' segments of the sg mRNAs are assumed to be joined during discontinuous negative-strand RNA synthesis. This step produces the templates for sg mRNA synthesis and is directed by a base-pairing interaction between conserved transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) [14] [15] [16] . Such TRSs are found at the 3 0 end of the leader sequence (leader TRS) and at different positions upstream of genes in the genomic 3 0 proximal domain (body TRSs). The synthesis of subgenome-length negativestranded RNAs is directed by the complement of a body TRS at the 3 0 end of a nascent minus-strand base pairing with the leader TRS, with the extent of sequence complementarity being an important determinant of the level at which a given sg mRNA is produced [13] . In this study, two types of gene silencing techniques were implemented computationally, siRNA and miRNA. siRNA also called silencing RNA is generally a double-stranded RNA and contains 21 base pairs in length. The central role of siRNA is posttranscriptional gene silencing by interfering with the protein, and their basic mechanism is to bind and promote the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) at specific sequences [17] . An effective siRNA has to contain some basic features like A/U at the 5 0 end of the antisense strand, G/C at the 5 0 end of the sense strand, at least 5 A/U residues in the 5 0 terminal end or one third of the antisense strand and absence of any GC stretch of more than 9 nucleotide in length. If designed siRNA fails to fulfill above criteria, then gene silencing is not possible by that particular siRNA [18] . Each siRNA strand contains a 5 0 phosphate group and a 3 0 hydroxyl (OH) group, produced from dsRNA or hairpin looped RNA. By using nanoparticles like polyethyleneimine and other approaches, siRNA can be introduced into the cell for specific knockdown of a gene of interest, after entering into the cell siRNA cleaved by an enzyme called dicer (RNase III-like enzyme). Then the siRNA incorporated with multi-subunit protein complex called RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC seeks out the correct target mRNA, and then siRNA unwinds and is believed. After this process, the antisense strand directs degradation of the complementary strand of appropriate mRNA using different kinds of endo and exogenous enzymes [19] . siRNA may also be used for therapeutic purpose like vaccine, and their efficacy can be ensured to more than 75 % to knockout or kill any targeted gene or protein [20] . Mature miRNA regulates diverse cellular processes in plant and animal species through the assembly of miRNA-induced RISC complex which binds to the complementary targets in the cellular mRNA and subsequently cleaves or transcriptionally represses the mRNA depending on the complementarity. In addition, recent studies suggest that miRNA also play a role in the regulation of viral infection [21] . Therefore, in the present study an effort has been made to identify potential siRNA and miRNA molecules for silencing of ORF1ab coding mRNA or gene in MERS-CoV using computational approach.

Background: On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 in humans was reported in Wuhan, and then spread fast to other provinces, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to describe the evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission in Guangdong Province. Methods: A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of confirmed cases were collected from medical records. Exposure and travel history were obtained by interview. Results: A total of 1,151 confirmed cases were identified as of February 10, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, 697 (60.1%) cases were from 234 cluster infections. Two hundred and fourteen (18.6%) were secondary cases, in which 144 cases were from family cluster infections. With the epidemic continuing, although familial cluster events were dominated, community cluster events increased with a nosocomial event. The whole genomes within the same family cluster infections were identical, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared with SARS-CoV-2 identified on December 2019 in Wuhan. Conclusions: We observed evident human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong, China. Although most of them were from family cluster infections, community and nosocomial infections were increasing. Our findings indicate that human-to-human transmission risks are transferring from family to community in Guangdong Province.

The available data and expert opinions suggest that patients with IBD are not at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the general recommendation is to stay on IBD therapies with a goal of sustaining remission, ideally defined as a composite of both symptomatic (clinical) remission and objectively confirmed inflammation control (endoscopic improvement and normalized laboratory values). Patients should be advised to maintain their current regimens and to avoid relapse due to non-adherence. Aside from the obvious negative consequences of a relapse, relapsing IBD will strain available medical resources, may require steroid therapy or necessitate hospitalization, outcomes that are all much worse than the known risks of existing IBD therapies. Similar to the recommendations to the general population, patients with IBD should practice strict social distancing, work from home, have meticulous hand hygiene, and separate themselves from known infected individuals. The Wuhan IBD Center experience of their 318 patients demonstrates the benefit of this approach. 21 The healthcare team there instituted immediate alerts to their population to stay at home and practice strict social distancing. Despite being in the epicenter of COVID-19 in Wuhan, none of their patients subsequently developed COVID-19. 21 Patients with IBD and their providers have expressed concerns about going to infusion centers for delivery of infusible IBD therapies (e.g. infliximab, ustekinumab, vedolizumab). The IOIBD consensus supports ongoing use of infusion centers provided that the center had a COVID-19 screening protocol in place. Infusion centers should have a protocol that includes pre-screening of patients for exposure or symptoms of COVID-19, fever checks at the door, adequate spacing between chairs (minimum of 6 feet), masks and gloves used by providers and provided to patients, and adequate deep cleaning after patient departure. Elective switching to injectable therapies is not recommended, and a prior trial exploring this in patients receiving infliximab who were switched to adalimumab was associated with relapses. 22 In addition, switching to home infusions may seem appealing as a way to limit exposure, but this is not recommended. There are many uncontrolled variables, and there is a serious risk that a nurseprovider traveling from home to home may become infected and act as a vector to other patients.

From a clinical and epidemiological perspective, there is obvious interest in whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt to become more transmissible and/or virulent in humans. Before we can address this question, it is importantly to realize that most evolutionary options available to this virus have already been explored in bats, where there is an immense array of genetically distinct coronaviruses. Viruses in the betacoronavirus genus, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, have likely been infecting bats for tens of millions of years, possibly since the origin of bats themselves [3] . Within this natural reservoir, viruses exist that would cause high and low virulence in humans, as well as those viruses that are easily transmissible from human to human. Evolution tinkers with these viruses in bats, and the epidemiological consequences are seen both in pathogenic zoonotic diseases (e.g., SARS, MERS, and COVID-19) and in the less-virulent circulating coronaviruses causing common colds. Occasionally, however, some evolutionary avenues are not available to a zoonotic pathogen until after arrival in humans [4] .

For example, lyssaviruses such as Hendra are periodically transmitted from bats to horses and then to humans who contact the infected horse. Similarly, SARS-CoV was shown to be transmitted from bats to civet cats and from them to humans. To date, a virus identical to SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified in bats or any other non-human species, making its origins unclear. To date, the most closely related coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2, is the bat coronavirus, BatCoV RaTG1, which has 96% whole-genome identity to SARS-CoV-2. 50 Hence other genetic factors could underlie the apparent lack of susceptibility of dogs to COVID-19 clinical infection.

The COVID-19 has been confirmed to spread from person to person, mainly transmitting through respiratory secretions or direct contact. At present, the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is based on clinical symptoms, contact history of epidemic area, imaging diagnosis, and nucleic acid detection. However, false negative in nucleic acid detection has been reported, and the clinical symptoms may be atypical that may cause misdiagnosis and make the situation spread. Therefore, the imaging examination becomes particularly important. In this study, the CT images of 130 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia were collected and their imaging features were analyzed. The NCP was classified for the first time according to its distribution characteristics and the CT signs were further interpreted from the perspectives of anatomy, pathophysiology, and immunity, in order to improve the radiologists' familiarity with the disease and help make the early diagnosis and show insights in the development of disease on follow-up CT.

For work involving coronavirus structural genes, targeted RNA recombination is likely to remain the method of choice for many studies. One reason for this is its relative ease of manipulation. The largest of the donor RNA vectors are still threefold smaller than an entire genome. Thus mutagenesis at the DNA level can generally be carried out without subcloning steps. A second strong asset of targeted recombination is that the host range-based selection system has demonstrated both its efficiency, in straightforward isolation of desired mutants, and its power, in recovery of extremely defective mutants such as the M protein truncation and the E gene deletion Masters 2002, 2003) . Finally, targeted recombination lends itself well to studies involving domain exchange between different proteins (Peng et al. 1995b) , the exchange of genomic elements (Hsue and Masters 1997) , or the creation of mutants containing multiple mutations. In these cases the system, through its own selection of allowable crossover sites, can reveal which substitutions retain functionality and which are lethal. Related to this, the targeted recombination system establishes a stringent criterion for the lethality of a given mutation. If markers, silent or otherwise, upstream and downstream of the mutation in question can be transferred from a single donor RNA to progeny recombinants, while the mutation itself is excluded by multiple crossover events, then this argues strongly that the mutation produces a lethal phenotype (de Haan et al. 1998; Hsue et al. 2000) . In this situation the donor RNA provides its own internal control. As mentioned above, a similarly convincing standard of lethality for the infectious clones will require a more vigorous RNA production at passage zero. The sum of these considerations makes it likely that targeted recombination will serve a useful role in coronavirus genetics for some time to come.

The initial demonstration of targeted RNA recombination was soon followed by a report of the incorporation of genetic markers into the MHV genome by using a defective interfering (DI) RNA, MIDI-C, as the donor RNA ( Fig. 2 ) (van der Most et al. 1992) . In this case, a coding-silent marker tagging the region of the Alb4 N gene deletion was successfully transferred from the DI RNA to Alb4 recipient virus. Additionally, it was shown that recombinants bearing MIDI-C-derived markers that had been transduced into gene 1 of wild-type MHV could be isolated by screening, without any prior selection. Most importantly, the efficiency of obtaining recombinants with this DI RNA as the donor appeared to Shown at the top of each panel is the genome from which the donor RNAs are derived. Brackets indicate fragments of full-length genes be significantly higher than had been achieved with sgRNA7 as the donor. Coronavirus DI RNAs are parasitic elements that arise through the accumulation of extensive deletions, which eliminate most of the coding capacity of the genome while retaining cis-acting elements essential for viral polymerase recognition. They are therefore not independently viable, but they replicate by feeding into the RNA synthesis machinery provided by a helper virus.

The farm was put in quarantine, workers were sent to hospital for observation and the level of alert was raised from 'vigilance' to 'serious' throughout the territory. Eighty thousand chickens were destroyed in a 3-km zone around the farm, as well as 10 000 in the central market of Cheung Sha Wan, where all the live poultry raised on the territory and imported from China must converge before being sent to retail markets. The sale of live poultry was suspended in Hong Kong for 21 days (Benitez and Lam, 2008) . It was the first time since February 2003 that an H5N1 virus was found on a poultry farm. In 1997, 5000 chickens had been found infected with this new virus, as well as 12 humans, among whom two-thirds consequently died of this virus. The new government of Tung-Chee Wah, under Chinese sovereignty, decided to destroy 1.5 million chickens in November 1997. In 2008, Hong Kong health authorities feared that this new virus would spread from person to person, and then to the rest of the world, as it had been the case in 2003 for the SARS coronavirus (Abraham, 2007) . They imposed measures of biosecurity on poultry farms and retail markets, such as cleaning and quarantine, the most spectacular being the massive killing of 90 000 chickens. The decrease in the number of chickens destroyed was due to the decrease of live poultry raised or imported on the territory. Since these measures of eradication had been decided, no human case of Avian Influenza had been found in Hong Kong.

Coronavirus, which can cause respiratory syndrome, to date has affected over seventeen thousand individuals, especially in China. Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (MCs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. Virus activate MCs which release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provokes the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members including IL-1 and IL-33. Here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family members.

Similarly to other coronaviruses, MERS coronavirus is prone to mutations and can acquire an enhanced ability to be transmitted to human beings and between human beings. Such mutations would increase the risk of a pandemic, especially since several million pilgrims travel throughout the year from all continents to Saudi Arabia, with much of this travel associated with the Hajj and Umrah. Fortunately, no increase in MERS cases related to the Hajj has been reported.11 As with Ebola virus disease, no specific or effective drug treatment or vaccine exists for MERS. Infection prevention and control measures remain crucial to prevent spread of MERS coronavirus during the mass gathering religious events12 and to avoid secondary outbreaks in contacts.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the world greatly. While much remains unknown, the severity of the illness is quite alarming. The disease outbreak is still ongoing with a rapidly growing number of patients. With confirmed human-to-human transmission, this disease has put pregnant women at risk, endangering the lives of infected mothers and their babies. However, current data so far have been mainly focused on general population but not for these patients, and we were not sure if SARS-COV-2 can be vertical transmitted from mothers to their babies. Here, we report the clinical, laboratory, radiological profiles and treatment outcomes of these five COVID- 19 pregnant women and provide clinical information of their neonates.

The degree of emergency of spinal surgical indications highly depends on human resources (i.e. intensive care and anesthesiology medical and paramedical staff) as well as the availability of mechanical ventilation. In COVID-19 cluster regions, postanesthesia care units and/or operative rooms might have been turned into intensive care units, thus resulting in limited availability for operated patients. Furthermore, pathways of remaining operating theaters need to be divided into a COVID+ sector and a COVID-sector. In case of COVID+ theaters, a specific protocol needs to be applied. During the preparation phase, the anesthesiologist and nurse work in the theater, whereas the surgical team prepares the required devices and implants outside the theater. Whenever possible, the surgical team should be reduced to a minimum (surgeon and scrub nurse). A second scrub nurse stays outside to provide additional devices if required. After surgery, the patient might be extubated and immediate postoperative care should be provided in the operating theater as post-operative care units might not be accessible. If one of these units remains operational, it should be allocated to COVID-patients. The operated COVID patient will be directly transferred from the theater to a dedicated COVID hospitalization ward. When the patient has left the operating theater, cleaning of the room should only be performed after one hour, as a high concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus might still be present in the air. These considerations lead to very limited access to urgent surgical procedures in COVID-19 patients, which needs to be taken into account preoperatively by the surgeon when formulating a surgical indication.

During the 1980s, several important findings were reported. The coronavirus genomic RNA is transcribed into a set of subgenomic mRNAs that encode viral proteins. Using the model MHV, these subgenomic RNAs were shown to each contain a leader sequence derived from the 59 end of the genome (Lai et al., 1982) , initially by RNA fingerprinting methods. These nested subgenomic RNAs came to define a larger superfamily of Nidoviruses ("nidus" means nest) including several other virus families. Later it was found that subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed from negative strand RNAs that were synthesized from the full-length genomic RNA (Wu and Brian, 2010) . This is a unique mechanism involving noncontiguous transcription of the genome, presumed to occur by a process involving viral polymerase jumping from one part of the genome template to another. This leads to a high rate of recombination for coronaviruses, which may play a role in viral evolution and interspecies infections. However, the ancestral bat virus of SARS-CoV-2, the species from which it was transferred to humans, and the sequence changes leading to the evolution of this highly pathogenic virus have yet to be identified.

Based on the available evidence, the COVID-19 virus is transmitted from person to person through close contact and droplets, resembling the spread of influenza. 2 The WHO and British Columbia Center for Disease Control recommend the use of standard, contact, and droplet precautions including a surgical mask, eye protection (eg, goggles and/or face shield), gown, and gloves when providing direct care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Airborne precautions including an N95, FFP2, or equivalent respirator; eye protection; gown; and gloves should be used during any aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs). 3, 4 Our air medical teams operate in challenging, space-restricted environments in both fixed and rotary wing aircraft. The confined space, limited airflow, and inability to stop and exit the aircraft mean that our crews use PPE differently than our ground-based colleagues. The BCEHS CCT program quickly identified challenges associated with the WHO's recommended PPE use including the changing of soiled N95 masks in close proximity to patients and the snag risks associated to gowns and aprons. As a result, we opted to adapt our PPE to include hospital scrubs, 1-piece Tyvek suits with hoods, and half facepiece reusable silicone respirators with extended life particulate filters for enhanced durability and increased comfort. The use of powered air-purifying respirators and patient isolation pods continue to be investigated.

The current pandemic of Covid-19 infection (coronavirus disease 2019; previously 2019-nCoV) began in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, which then spread to the rest of the country and globally. 4 As of March 25, 2020, 183 other countries and regions, with more than 1.252.265 confirmed cases at April 5, 2020, are declared. Among the confirmed cases, 256.059 are recovered cases, and 67.999 died. 5 Although human coronaviruses have been considered harmless for decades, their clinical importance and epidemic possibility were recognized after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Particularly, Covid-19 spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. The median time between exposure and symptoms onset is three days (ranges from 0 to 24 days). Initial symptoms are often fever, cough, and nasal congestion that can progress to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 6 On the contrary, most infected children have an asymptomatic course or mild clinical manifestations with a good prognosis. Few may evolve into lower respiratory infections. Moreover, gastrointestinal involvement and persistent positive rectal swabs in pediatric patients are recently described. 7 Currently, whether a state of immunosuppression can contribute to worsening outcome in children during Covid-19 infection is unknown. In 2018, Ogimi et al. in a retrospective study demonstrated that children immunocompromised affected by human coronaviruses infections presented a worse clinical course and respiratory involvement compared to immunocompetent children. 8 To date, the existence of an association between ITP and Covid-19 infection has not yet been described as well as whether the impact on platelet count differs from other well-known viruses.

These industries employ local and international workers who then travel to and from wild territories (Allouche 2015) . Anthropocentric activity also disrupts normal animal behaviour, for example, changing fruit bat roosting and foraging ranges so that they move to proximate sites to human dwellings (Looi and Chua 2007) . Further, evidence suggests that biodiversity is a key element in emergent zoonotic diseases, where, in some cases, there is a reversed correlation: less biodiversity, or even deprived ecologies, create more risks for human zEIDs spillover events (Cardinale et al. 2012; Jones 2008) . 3. Prevention of zoonotic infections. Non-pharmaceutical measures can work well in EID outbreaks, but are only practical considerations once the spillover event has occurred in humans (in other contexts, personal protection equipment might be used as biosafety measures). Reactive pharmaceutical measures, such as vaccines, take time to develop to specific pathogens, and then are often hampered by politics and investment, biological limitations, errors, and logistics. Prevention, as is central to public health, might therefore be considered key. Currently, several types of Ebola vaccines have been proven effective and safe in primates, but none has been approved in humans yet (see below). Human trials however are ongoing; and several captive chimpanzee trials have been conducted Warfield et al. 2014) . Once an Ebola vaccine is approved for use in humans, several strategies to increase coverage may be used, such as ensuring that eco-tourists are appropriately vaccinated before visiting at-risk primate populations, and introducing health programmes in mining and refining communities often located in remote areas and near to potential Ebola hotspots, such as bat roosts. 4. Monitoring of disease in animals. Studies have identified stereotypic behaviours in animals when burdened with zoonotic disease. For example, gorillas faced with endemic Ebola reacted in ways that point to a decrease in social cohesion and lower reproductive potential: females were significantly more likely to transfer from breeding groups to non-breeding groups and males were more likely to transfer from groups to solitary-living. In general, there was a decrease in formation of breeding groups. Interestingly, during the post-epidemic period, immigration of breeders between groups returned to normal while immigration of non-breeders remained low. Observable social dynamics, then, may be used as indicators to detect Ebola outbreaks (Genton et al. 2014 ). This is an example of how animals can act as sentinels for imminent human risk. 16 5. Animal-to-human transmission. Several routes of animal-human transmission of Ebola exist, including ingestion of raw infected meat (bats, primates and other animals) , and exposure to hosts and reservoirs through daily life, professions and tourism (Köndgen et al. 2008 ). These various routes are potentially causing more zEID spillover events. For example, 'bushmeat' is consumed in higher amounts due to population growth in some areas (Wolfe et al. 2005) ; mining is a growing industry in many regions (see below); and local economies rely on the growth of ecotourism. Presenting these as local and global issues is challenging: for example, the local population is unlikely to support the prohibition of eating specific species as part of infection control. Moreover, to have ethical credence, it would be consistent to address concurrent risks in developed countries, such as reducing intensive farming that also drives zEIDs. As regional industrial growth is essential for creating sustainable development for all countries, a call to reduce anthropocentric activity in rich wildlife areas in order to meet expedient conservation efforts would likely be rejected because of the local economic losses (and the international desire to visit such areas). Nonetheless, efforts should be aimed at education of locals and visitors about the modes of transmission of Ebola (Muyembe-Tamfum et al. 2012 ). Learning about the local ecology-animal behaviour, biology, anthropology-would point to innovative ways to adapt in order to reduce the risk of transmission.

The ingredients in complete animal feeds come from a wide range of raw materials, so it is not surprising that contamination with enteric pathogens, like Salmonella, occurs (Ge et al., 2013) . The link between the spread of Salmonella from contaminated animal feed to both animals and humans causing illness has been well established (Jones, 2011; Crump et al., 2002) . Along with Salmonella, food-producing animals have been identified as major reservoirs for many human pathogens, including Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp., Escherichia coli (including O157:H7), Yersinia spp., and Enterococcus spp. (Mead et al., 1999; Crump et al., 2002) . While pathogens of bacterial origin seem to be the most prevalent, viral pathogens should not be overlooked as possible hazards in animal feeds and pet foods. More recently the coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been found to be transmitted via feed (Dee et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2014) . Although PEDV is not a human pathogen, it generated significant economic losses in North America after its introduction in 2013 (Cochrane et al., 2016a,b) . In swine feeds, PEDV was the first substantial viral pathogen to be transmitted by feed and may not be the only. More recently mammalian orthoreovirus has been detected in swine feces and swine blood meal with contaminated blood meal found to be infective (Narayanappa et al., 2015) . In addition to swine viruses being reported, a surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was reported in many poultry flocks throughout the United States in 2015 (APHIS Report). However, no definitive proof-of-concept studies have established feed as a vector for HPAI, as of this publication.

More recently the coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has been found to be transmitted via feed (Dee et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2014) . Although PEDV is not a human pathogen, it generated significant economic losses in North America after its introduction in 2013 (Cochrane et al., 2016a,b) . In swine feeds, PEDV was the first substantial viral pathogen to be transmitted by feed and may not be the only. More recently mammalian orthoreovirus has been detected in swine feces and swine blood meal with contaminated blood meal found to be infective (Narayanappa et al., 2015) . In addition to swine viruses being reported, a surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was reported in many poultry flocks throughout the United States in 2015 (APHIS Report). However, no definitive proof-of-concept studies have established feed as a vector for HPAI, as of this publication.

The ANDV DIII, including the stem region, was largely insoluble and therefore this larger Gc fragment could not be tested in the ANDV entry assays. The R1 peptide spanning the first 17 N-terminal residues of the 44-residue stem region did not affect ANDV entry, while the R2 peptide spanning the last 20 C-terminal residues blocked ANDV infection to a similar extent as DIII. When we tested the two peptides R2.1 and R2.2, comprising either the N-or C-terminal half of the ANDV R2 stem peptide, the inhibitory activity against ANDV was largely retained by both peptides. Hence, the R2 peptide seems to contain residues in these two regions that participate similarly during inhibition. Similar to the C-terminal region of the ANDV stem region, the C-terminal region, but not the N-terminal, of DV2 E protein binds and blocks the fusion protein [47] . Interestingly, inhibitory peptides derived from membrane proximal regions (or stem regions) of diverse fusion proteins such as those of RVFV, DV2, SARS-coronavirus, Influenza virus, and Hepatitis C virus have been found likely to interact with membrane interfaces by a hydropathy segment [74] , which is predicted by the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) for the transfer of a peptide from an aqueous environment to a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl choline interface [75, 76] . A need for such a membrane-binding property for inhibitory activity coincides with studies on peptides derived from the stem region of alphavirus fusion proteins; these peptides generate WWIHS below values of 1 (S1 Table) , indicative of weak membrane binding [74] , and fail to block alphavirus fusion activity [44, 72] . In the case of the DV2 E protein, such a membrane-binding sequence is found at the C-terminal end of the peptide [48] with a high WWIHS value (S1 Table) . In fact, the stem peptides of the DV2 E protein have been shown to interfere with the fusion of the virus in the endosomal compartment by a two-step mechanism: first by binding to the viral membrane outside the cell, and next by binding against the E core trimer once fusion has been triggered in the endocytic compartment (47) . Using the Wimley-White scale [77] , an interfacial hydropathy segment with a WWIHS vale >5 was predicted for the ANDV Gc stem region that coincides with the sequence of the R2 peptide (S1 Table) , indicative for moderate membrane partitioning [74] . If the ANDV R2 peptide would interact with membranes by a hydropathy segment, then such an interaction did not favor ANDV inhibition sufficiently in the endosomal route, since fusion impairment was most efficient when directly present in the fusion compartment; when applied at the same concentration, the R2 stem peptide blocked 45% of ANDV infection when entry occurred via the endocytic pathway, while R2 reached over 95% inhibition of ANDV infection when fusion occurred at the plasma membrane. In this sense, modifications to the R2 peptide that favor membrane interaction, such as those introduced to peptides derived from the West Nile virus E stem region [48] or the membrane proximal region of Influenza virus hemagglutinin and HIV gp41 [78, 79] , may help in the future to improve its inhibitory activity and to direct it towards the closed environment of endosomes.

Behavior analysts have begun to adopt strategies for teaching empathic responding and perspective taking with children diagnosed with autism (e.g., Schrandt, Townsend, & Poulson, 2009 ). In addition, these behaviors may be useful among siblings, children to parents, parents to children, and among partners and other family members to create therapeutic support networks and help build tolerance for or alleviate stress across the family unit (Arciniega, Szabo, & Tarbox, 2020; Szabo, 2019; Szabo et al., 2020) . For example, Arciniega et al. (2020) taught experimenters to use empathic statements when listening to the concerns of siblings who had been aggressive with children with autism, and then taught the participants to use similar empathic statements when engaging in activities with their siblings with autism. To further supplement this skill, members of the family may be taught to first engage in value-clarification exercises. For example, after drawing a coat of arms with four to six sections, family members can illustrate those aspects of their connection with each other that are of the highest value to them (Asen & Scholz, 2009 ). Sections of the coat of arms could include images of superpowers that family members use to protect one another's health and well-being. 2. Use a 5-min pause: acting without reacting. Stay-athome orders are likely to increase the frequency of verbal conflicts between parents. Children observe the actions of their parents, and if parent actions are reinforced, children are likely to imitate what they see. Parents may be negatively reinforced when using coercion in their interactions with each other, and thereby teach their children to do the same. Behavior analysts should discuss the way that these practices are transmitted from parents to their children through the parents' unintentional modeling of them. Parents can therefore be taught to pause before responding to conflict or stressful disagreements with others. The practice of pausing when agitated can be discussed with children as a heroic family value and established as a norm that is immediately reinforced by adults . 3. Use a Jumble Jar. Sitting still and remaining at family meals may be challenging for many children because it is not clear what they will talk about and because topics preferred by parents (e.g., the latest news on COVID-19) may not be preferred by children. A Jumble Jar provides structure to family meals and a simple way for members to connect with themselves and each other. A jar is filled with sentence starters, or "jumbles," that family members take turns pulling from the jar and discussing during meals (e.g., Price & Nelson, 2019) . Family members should be instructed to use active listening skills (e.g., "I hear you saying that you dream of going snorkeling because you want to learn about sea creatures.") and to ask respondents to expand on shorter answers that they offer.

Abstract There is evidence that the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is of animal origin. As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.

Introduction Discharge from intensive care is a potentially vulnerable time for patients who are recovering from critical illness. Recent data from the ANZICS group have highlighted that the mortality diff erence in those patients who are discharged out of hours is nearly twice that of those discharged during the day [1] . These results have been replicated in our institution with a mortality of 8.7% (discharged 22:00 to 06:59) versus 4.8% (discharged 07:00 to 21:59). In the UK, NICE CG50 advised that transfer from critical care to the ward out of hours should be avoided and documented as an adverse event. We postulated that one important factor in our hospital is the decreased medical and nursing cover overnight and so looked at the delay from discharge to fi rst medical review and to outreach review. Methods The case notes of 100 consecutive patients discharged to the ward between September 2013 and October 2013 were examined to identify the time of discharge from the ICU and the subsequent fi rst review by the receiving medical team and the Critical Care Outreach team. The grade of the doctor reviewing the patient was recorded.

The virus is highly infectious and can transfer from person to person. As predicted previously by various researchers worldwide, COVID-19 emerged as pandemic. The present situation clearly calls for the fast and efficient availability of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Worldwide scientists already are working tirelessly for efficient and effective solution of COVID-19 pandemic; meanwhile, it is moral and social obligation of each individual on the planet to follow the guidelines and advisory from the government, the WHO, and other responsible agencies. Extended support and cooperation from public can only help to control the spread of COVID-19 further.

The virus is thought to mainly transmit from person to person by air droplets and close contact. Essential steps of controlling this disease focus on early detection and isolation of the confirmed cases, followed by tracing and screening their contacts, which is fundamental for minimizing the risk of spread, specifically the isolation and management of the asymptomatic cases 2 . Previous report has demonstrated the existence of incomplete clinical presentations of SARS 3 , 80% genetically similarity with SARS-CoV-2. We found 15 asymptomatic cases who were tested positive by RT-PCR assay during the contact-screening of the confirmed COVID-19 patients in Fengjie county, northeastern Chongqing, where is adjacent to Hubei, the center of COVID-19 outbreak in China. Fifteen people in the absence of complaints were tested positive by twice real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method through nasopharygeal or rectal swabs. All of these cases were either family members or close contacts with certain confirmed cases either symptomatic or asymptomatic, consisting of five males and ten females. The age ranged from 5 to 76 years old. We did not see any significant alternation of WBC, lymphocytes, PLT, CRP and PCT as previous described in the symptomatic patients 4, 5 . Nonetheless, there are three notable changes of the laboratory examinations, which is likely to offer some clues for the identification, management and prevention of asymtomatic cases. Firstly, the initial laboratory examinations showed that erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR) increased in 10/15 cases. Considering of the less specificity and reproducibility, of course, it is true that ESR cannot be the sole clue to disease in asymptomatic state, which must combined with epidemiological link and other evidence 6 ; secondly, eight of the fifteen cases had decreased albumin; thirdly, twelve cases presented with abnormal electrolytes such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesium. The abnormality of the albumin and electrolytes may indicate the insufficient nutrition weaken the immune system. A diet supplementation especially on these elements should be considered for the asymptomatic cases.

In less than five months the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has spread from an initial foci in Wuhan, China to nearly every corner of the globe. At the time of writing, over 300,000 deaths had been reported, which will likely move this emerging infection into the top five viral causes of death this year. Several clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 have contributed to its disastrous effects worldwide. The overlap in symptoms with many endemic and milder respiratory infections -such as influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and seasonal coronaviruses -make syndromic identification of cases difficult. The relatively high percentage of infected individuals who require hospitalization or critical care compared to seasonal respiratory infections has put an unprecedented burden on the healthcare systems of hard-hit regions. The important role of asymptomatic individuals in transmitting infection makes symptom-based isolation ineffective. Perceived ambiguity about the case fatality risk from COVID-19 and misguided comparisons to seasonal influenza contributed to sluggish responses in many regions, in contrast to previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS.

The outbreak is declared as pandemic and public health emergency of international concern declared by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the present health emergency exhibited close resemblance with SARS-CoV. Both the viruses are zoonotic and belong to a large family of viruses Coronaviridae. The complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins, namely spikes (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) encoded by virus genome. The S protein of virus shows similarity to S protein of SARS-CoV. COVID-19 spreads from person to person, and this makes it more vulnerable for causing infection. Several efforts are taken to find prevention strategies for COVID-19. Researchers across the globe are working to find effective vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. There is no vaccine or medication available till date for COVID-19. Preventive measures such as social distancing, awareness, maintenance of hygiene, isolation, and movement restrictions can help in control of COVID-19 spread. Proper sanitization and cleaned and sanitized public transport can be effective in inhibiting the spread of the virus. In the present situation of medical emergency, cooperation and support by following advices from the WHO and government only facilitate everyone to come over.

The coronavirus epidemic that started in China has rapidly spread to all countries of the world and caused a significant number of deaths. The situation was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) China office on December 31, 2019 as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in the city of Wuhan (population ~11 million) in the Hubei province. 1, 2, 3, 4 The disease was believed to have originated in a seafood market, which was closed for disinfection on January 1, 2020. Of 44 cases reported on January 3, 2020, 11 patients had severe disease while 33 patients were stable. 2,3 On January 7, 2020, it was determined that the epidemic was caused by a novel coronavirus (nCoV). Thailand reported its first case on January 13 and Japan on January 15, while on January 20 the first case was reported in Korea and 6 were reported dead in the city of Wuhan. Later, it appeared in countries such as the United States, Vietnam, Singapore, and Australia, and spread to the European nations, starting with France on January 25, 2020. The WHO reported that the first cases in Wuhan had been infected via animals, after which the virus was transmitted from person to person and detected in clusters among families. 3 On January 30, 2020, the epidemic was recognized as a public health emergency of international concern, and on February 11, 2020, the WHO named the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19.

In contrast, two out of the three horses inoculated with 2 ml of the vaccine exhibited swelling at the inoculation site after the second vaccination. None of the horses developed a fever after the vaccinations. Administration of more than 2 ml of the vaccine to horses would likely increase the risk of adverse reactions.

HKU23 may have been transmitted from infected camels to those horses. Horse No. 5 in the present study may have also been in contact with infected cows, and BCoV may have been transmitted from infected cows to the horse.

The International Committee on Taxonomy (ICT) of viruses has classified coronaviruses under family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales. Toroviruses and coronaviruses are the two representative genera of the family Coronaviridae; they have been further classified in subfamily Coronavirinae. On the basis of rooted and unrooted genetic trees and partial nucleotide sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, subfamily Coronavirinae has been recognized and classified into four genera-alpha (α) coronavirus, beta (β) coronavirus, gamma (γ) coronavirus, and delta (δ) coronavirus (Woo et al. 2009 (Woo et al. , 2012a . The α coronaviruses and β coronaviruses infect only warm-blooded animals. The γ coronaviruses and δ coronaviruses infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals. Phylogenetic relationship of various human and animal coronaviruses and the list of known coronaviruses are shown in Fig. 12.2 and Tables 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3, respectively. Infection with α coronaviruses and β coronaviruses leads to respiratory disorders in human and gastrointestinal disorders in animals (Su et al. 2016; Forni et al. 2017; Gorbalenya et al. 2006) . Currently available genetic sequence databases of all human coronaviruses reveal with its animal origins: Viruses of the family Coronaviridae are listed, with their abbreviations and natural animal reservoir (Cavanagh 1997) (Table 12. 2). Domestic animals can act as an intermediate host to transmit these viruses from their reservoir host to the humans. Sometimes domestic animal may acquire infection with closely related zoonotic coronaviruses (Woo et al. 2009 (Woo et al. , 2012a . Extensive research study on the source of infection of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has found bat as a reservoir, and it has laid to the better understanding of coronavirus microbiology. At present, seven species of α coronavirus and four species of β coronavirus have been identified only in bats (Su et al. 2016; Lau et al. 2013; Perlman and Netland 2009; Woo et al. 2012b; Graham et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2015; de Wit et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2017 ).

Nucleotide sequence analysis of some human enteric viruses has indicated a high degree of sequence similarity with animal strains. Notably, hepatitis E virus-related sequences have been detected in pigs (Meng, 2000; van der Poel et al., 2001; Banks et al., 2004) and birds (Huang et al., 2002) . Zoonotic infections may occur either through direct transmission, suspected for hepatitis E virus (HEV; Reyes, 1993) and caliciviruses (Humphrey et al., 1984) , or through incidental co-infection of a host with animal and human viruses, resulting in the mixing of genes and generation of novel variants (recombination/reassortment; Unicomb et al., 1999) . Recombination has been demonstrated as a mechanism for rapid expansion of diversity for noroviruses and rotaviruses, but it is likely to be a common feature of the RNA viruses involved (Jiang et al., 1999; Unicomb et al., 1999; Lopman et al. 2004) . Viruses related to the human rotaviruses, astroviruses, noroviruses, sapoviruses, and HEV circulate in several animal species, providing a huge reservoir for virus diversity (Shirai et al., 1985; Meng et al., 1997; van der Poel et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2002; Oliver et al., 2006) . To corroborate these hypotheses, animal viruses have been recently characterised in shellfish samples from the market either in Europe or in the US (Dubois et al., 2004; Costantini et al., 2006) . SARS, reported in November 2002 (Ksiazek et al., 2003 , is an example of an emerging disease. The primary mode of transmission of the SARS coronavirus appears to be direct mucous membrane contact with infectious respiratory droplets and/or through exposure to fomites. Several coronaviruses are known to spread by the faecal±oral route, but there is no current evidence that this mode of transmission plays a key role in the transmission of SARS, although there is a considerable shedding of the virus in stools (Tsang, 2003) . Another emerging pathogen of concern is the avian influenza H5N1 virus, highly pathogenic among birds, that in some cases has been transmitted from birds to humans. Most cases of H5N1 infection in humans to date have occurred as a result of direct contact with poultry or with surfaces and objects contaminated by their faeces. However, concern has recently been expressed about the potential for transmission of the virus to humans through water and sewage, although no definitive cases have been reported to date (WHO, 2006, http://www.who.int/ water_sanitation_health/emerging/h5n1background.pdf) .

While a number of different species of viruses cause upper and lower respiratory infections in transplant recipients, some similarities exist between these pathogens. In general, transmission of all of these viral pathogens occurs by spread from person to person through direct or close contact with contaminated secretions which may involve droplets or fomites. In addition, influenza virus may be spread by small particle aerosols. Accordingly, attention to good hygienic practices, in particular hand washing, should be part of infection control and prevention both in and out of the hospital. Supportive care is a mainstay of treatment. Specific antiviral agents are not available for coronavirus and parainfluenza. Specific data on RSV, influenza and PIV in the transplant population are discussed in more detail.

Glutamic acids inside the pores of ion channels. Being negatively charged at physiological pH, glutamic acid is perfectly suited for binding metal ions. This property is used in specific regulation of a variety of ion channels. For example, in cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels (which are found in vertebrate photoreceptors and olfactory epithelium, 77 elsewhere in the nervous system [78] [79] [80] and in a variety of other cell types including kidney, testis and heart, 81 and whose activation represents the final step in the transduction pathways in both vision and olfaction [82] [83] [84] ), a single glutamic acid strategically located in the pore represents the binding site for multiple monovalent cations, the blocking site for external divalent cations and the site for the effect of protons on permeation. 82 This is not too surprising since the pore region of the channel controls both the singlechannel conductance and the pore diameter of the channel. 85 Importantly, CNG channels are permeable to Ca 2+ , which is an important element in the activation of intracellular targets, and which in addition to permeating CNG channels can profoundly block the current flow carried by monovalent cations through the CNG channels. 83 This capability of Ca 2+ to block the monovalent cation flow is determined by the high-affinity binding of Ca 2+ to a single acidic amino acid residue located in the pore of the channel, which is Glu363 for the rod CNG channel and Glu333 for the catfish olfactory CNG channel. 86 This same glutamic acid residue is also responsible for the external rapid proton block of CNG channels, another characteristic that the CNG channels share with Ca 2+ channels. 86 Glutamic acid also plays an important regulatory role in the voltage-dependent calcium channels that are located in the plasma membrane and form a highly selective conduit by which Ca 2+ ions enter all excitable cells and some nonexcitable cells. 87 For these channels to operate, Ca 2+ ions must enter selectively through the pore, bypassing competition with other extracellular ions. The high selectivity of a unique Ca 2+ filter is determined pathway for protons utilized in the catalytic NO reduction; the carboxylate group of Glu215, which is located at the backside of Glu211, contributes to the electro-negative environment of the binuclear center of cNOR, and to the low redox potential of heme b 3 iron; finally Glu135 and Glu138 are positioned in the loop connecting the transmembrane helices III and IV, with Glu135 serving as one of the Ca 2+ ligands (which is crucial for maintaining the configuration of heme b and b 3 ) and assisting in the water-mediated proton transfer through interactions with a number of water molecules, and with Glu138 serving as a key residue for maintaining the unique conformation of the long loop through interactions with the residues in transmembrane helix II, which would stabilize the coordination of Glu135 to Ca 2+ . 100 Mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, which is responsible for the mono-ADP-ribosylation of proteins, possesses a critical glutamic acid at the catalytic cleft which functions to position NAD for nucleophilic attack at the N-glycosidic linkage for either ADPribose transfer or NAD hydrolysis. 101 The pronounced Na + /K + selectivity of Na,K-ATPase relies on the strategic positioning of glutamic acid residues. 102 Here, intramembrane Glu327 in transmembrane segment M4, Glu779 in M5, Asp804 and Asp808 in M6 are essential for tight binding of K + and Na + , whereas Asn324 and Glu327 in M4, together with Thr774, Asn776 and Glu779 in the 771-YTLTSNIPEITP motif of M5 contribute to the Na + / K + selectivity. 102 In the family of thiamin diphosphate enzymes, a highly conserved glutamate is known to promote the C 2 -H ionization and the thiamin diphosphate activation. 103 The direct catalytic role of glutamic acid can be seen in matrix metalloproteinases, which are ubiquitous endopeptidases characterized by an active site where a Zn 2+ atom, coordinated by three histidines, plays the catalytic role, assisted by a glutamic acid that acts as a general base. 104 For example, one of the wellknown zinc-binding metalloproteases that uses a glutamic acid residue as the fourth ligand to coordinate the zinc ion is thermolysin. In thermolysin, glutamic acid is 20 amino acids downstream from the second histidine in the first motif and present in a small conserved motif (NEXXSD). 105 In the zincin and PDF groups of metalloproteases, the catalytic zinc-binding site contains the HEXXHXXG motif. 105 Also, a glutamic acid residue may be catalytically active in the substrate-binding cleft of plant lysozymes. 106 Each enzyme in the α-amylase family of multidomain hydrolases and transferases has one glutamic acid and two aspartic acid residues necessary for activity. 107 The irreversible dealkylation reaction catalyzed by the O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) that directly repairs alkylation damage at the O 6 -position of guanine is accomplished by an active-site cysteine that participates in a hydrogen bond network with invariant histidine and glutamic acid residues, reminiscent of the serine protease catalytic triad. 108 The spore germination protease (GPR) that degrades small, acid soluble proteins (SASP) protecting spore's DNA against damage, is a structurally and functionally unique protease that utilizes glutamic acid residue to catalyze SASP degradation. 109 In the hydrolytic aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), catalytic but flexible glutamic acid residues located within the active site serve as the general base that activates the hydrolytic water molecule in the deacylation step. 110 to the net translocation of one electrical charge across the membrane per electron consumed. Second, an additional proton is translocated vectorially across the membrane for each electron consumed, resulting in a net transport of two electrical charges per electron. 96 The protons for the chemical reaction are extracted from the N-side of the membrane via two proton pathways, the D-and K-channels. The D-channel starts at a highly conserved residue, Asp 91 (bovine numbering; subunit I) near the N side, and continues to another highly conserved residue Glu242 that donates protons to the BNC, whereas the key residue in the K-channel is a highly conserved lysine (K319). 95 The D-channel is responsible for the delivery of four "pump" protons that are first transferred from Glu242 to a "loading" site above the BNC and then delivered to the P side via a proton-exit channel. The mystery of this mechanism is in the ability of Glu242 located at the end of the D-channel to somehow sort "pump" protons from "chemical" protons. 95 To explain this behavior, the glutamate valve model has been proposed according to which the side chain of Glu242 shuttles between a state protonically connected to the D channel, and a state connected to the BNC and the pump site. 97 In this proton valve model, the Glu242 motion depends on its protonation state, where the unprotonated residue remains predominantly in a "down" conformation, pointing toward the N side, and therefore facilitating the uptake of a proton, whereas protonation shifts the Glu242 to the "up" conformation, where the side chain of this important residue is swung toward the P side by ~4 Å. 97 Glutamic acid in the active sites of enzymes. In addition to serve multiple structural roles and being involved in regulation of various channels, glutamic acid residues, being positioned within or in the close proximity to the active sites, might have roles in the catalytic activities of various enzymes. One of the illustrative examples of the functional roles of glutamic acid can be found in bacterial nitric oxide reductase (NOR), which is a membraneintegrated enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of nitric oxide NO to nitrous oxide N 2 O using a type of anaerobic respiration where cytotoxic NO is immediately decomposed after its production from nitrite NO 2 − via the nitrite reductase-catalyzed reaction. [98] [99] [100] Three different NOR types are found in bacteria, with the cytochrome c dependent NOR (cNOR) that consists of two subunits, NorB and NorC, being the most extensively studied enzyme. Precise description of the complex catalytic mechanism of this important enzyme is outside the scopes of this review, and therefore only a small piece of the entire picture, where the roles of glutamic acid are emphasized, is briefly described below. The characteristic feature of cNORs is the presence of five conserved glutamic acid residues (Glu135, Glu138, Glu211, Glu215 and Glu280 in P. aeruginosa cNOR) within the NorB subunit consisting of 12 trans-membrane helices and containing the heme b and the binuclear center (heme b 3 /Fe B ) buried in the hydrophobic interior of its trans-membrane region. 100 Here, Glu211 is involved in the coordination of Fe B and its carboxylate functions as the shuttle for catalytic protons from Glu280 to the bound-NO; Glu280, which interacts with Glu211 but is not involved in direct interaction with Fe B , is an important player of the Thr330-Ser277-Glu280-Glu211 network that acts as a delivery matrix communication) and their ligands, it has been concluded that divalent cations are critical for integrin interactions with almost all ligands. Importantly, although divalent cations are bound to integrins, their coordination sphere is not completed and the interactions between integrin and its ligands typically involve completing the metal ion coordination with an acidic ligand residue. 115 For example, complexes between the human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the I domain of its integrin receptor αLβ2 are stabilized by a critical glutamate residue that completes the magnesium coordination in integrin. 116 Similarly, in the crystal structure of a complex between the I domain of a2b1 integrin and a triple-helical collagen peptide containing a critical GFOGER motif, glutamate residue from the collagen peptide completes the coordination sphere of the I domain metal ion. 117 Based on these observations it has been concluded that a metalglutamate handshake represents a basic mechanism of integrin I domain interaction with its binding partners. 115 Furthermore, it is believed now that the general mechanism by which integrins, these αβ-heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that are vital to the survival and function of nucleated cells, recognize their structurally diverse ligands relies on specific glutamic-acid-or aspartic-acid-based sequence motifs that function in a divalent cation-dependent and conformationally sensitive manner. 118 The levels of intracellular zinc in living cells are crucial for managing various cellular processes, such as growth, development and differentiation. Zinc is involved in protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and also plays a role in the control of gene transcription and the coordination of other biological processes controlled by proteins containing DNA-binding zinc finger motifs, RING fingers and LIM domains. 119 The physiologically relevant intracellular levels of zinc are controlled by specific zinc transporters which mostly transport zinc into cells from outside. 105 Members of one of the subfamilies of these transporters, LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP zinc Transporters (LZT), being similar to other ZIP transporters in secondary structure and ability to transport metal ions across the plasma membrane or intracellular membranes, possess a unique HEXPHEXGD motif containing conserved proline and glutamic acid residues, that fits the consensus sequence for the catalytic zinc-biding site of matrix metalloproteinases (HEXXHXXGXXH), and which is unprecedented in other zinc transporters. 105 In addition to this set of specific examples, one should keep in mind that all structures of the Ca 2+ -binding domains have in common a high negative surface potential usually associated with Asp or Glu residues. 120 Therefore, important glutamic acid residues responsible for calcium coordination can be found in various members of the major Ca 2+ -binding proteins, such as EF-hand domains, EGF-like domains, γ-carboxyl glutamic acid (GLA)-rich domains, cadherin domains, Ca 2+ -dependent (C)-type lectin-like domains and Ca 2+ -binding pockets of family C G-protein-coupled receptors. 120 A particularly intriguing role was described for the N-terminal glutamic acid residues in the canonical Ca 2+ -protein, α-lactabumin, 121 which is frequently used as a model protein in folding studies and in studies on the effect of calcium binding on protein structure, stability and folding. For example, In nudix hydrolases (which is a family of Mg 2+ -requiring enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties) there is a specific motif, Nudix box (GX 5 EX 7 REUXEEXGU, where U is a bulky hydrophobic residue), that forms a loop-α helix-loop structural motif that functions as a common Mg 2+ -binding and catalytic site. 111 It was emphasized that the overall catalytic powers of Nudix hydrolases consists in accelerating the reaction rate by 10 9 to 10 12 times. The reactions are accelerated 10 3 -10 5 -times by general base catalysis by a glutamate residue within, or beyond the Nudix box, or by a histidine beyond the Nudix box. The additional 10 3 -10 5 -fold rate acceleration is due to the Lewis acid catalysis provided by one, two, or three divalent cations. One divalent cation is coordinated by two or three conserved residues of the Nudix box, the initial glycine and one or two glutamate residues, together with a remote glutamate or glutamine ligand located outside the Nudix box. 111 Glutamic acids at various binding sites. Hemopexin is an important multifunctional plasma protein involved in the sequestering of heme released into the plasma from hemoglobin and myoglobin as the result of intravascular or extravascular hemolysis and due to skeletal muscle trauma or neuromuscular disease. It also possesses hyaluronidase activity, serine protease activity, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activity and is involved in the suppression of lymphocyte necrosis, inhibition of cellular adhesion, and binding of divalent metal ions. Finally, hemopexin possesses two highly exposed Arg-Gly-Glu sequences that may promote interaction with cell surfaces. 112 Glutamic acid plays an important role in defining the retinal binding site geometry of rhodopsin, which is the photoreceptor in vertebrate rod cells responsible for vision at low light intensities. 11-cis-retinal is the photoreactive chromophore located in the interior of the protein where it is covalently attached to a lysine side chain through a protonated Schiff base (PSB) linkage. 113 Based on the 13 C-NMR chemical shift data, it was concluded that Glu113 of rhodopsin is involved in charge interactions with the retinal PSB, which are crucial for maintaining rhodopsin in the inactive state in the dark and whose breaking leads to the protein activation. 113 A centrally located glutamic acid residue in position 6 of transmembrane segment VII of the main ligand-binding crevice of the chemokine 7TM receptors (GluVII:06) is crucial for recognition and binding of small molecule non-peptide ligands that contain one or two centrally located, positively charged nitrogen atoms and are characterized by relatively similar elongated overall structure with terminal aromatic moieties. 114 Furthermore, since this GluVII:06 is crucial for the binding and hence the function of a number of non-peptide ligands in several chemokine receptors, such as the CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 receptors, it serves as a selective anchor point for the centrally located, positively charged nitrogen of the small molecule ligands. 114 Glutamic acid and metal binding. The role of glutamic acid residues in coordination of various metal ions was already emphasized in sections discussing ion channels. A few other illustrative examples are listed below. Based on the analysis of the complexes formed between integrins (which are central molecules in the adhesion processes that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular group giving rise to the pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (pyro-Glu). However, it was emphasized that pyro-Glu is exclusively found at the N-terminal end of the thermal polymers when glutamic acid is a predominant amino acid in a mixture of amino acids subjected to thermal polymerization. 129 Another important glutamic acid-based PTM is gammacarboxylation catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase that transforms specific glutamate residues in proteins to gammacarboxy glutamic acid (Gla) in the presence of reduced vitamin K, molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide. 130 This modification is widely distributed in the animal kingdom and has a wide range of physiological implications, such as hemostasis, bone calcification and signal transduction. 130 In addition to be a target for various PTMs, glutamic acid itself can be used as an important protein modifier, giving raise to polyglutamylation, which is a specific PTM where polyglutamate chains of variable lengths are added to the modified protein. 131 Polyglutamylation is evolutionarily conserved and is commonly found in the microtubule (MT) building block, tubulin. This PTM, being primarily found within the tubulin C-terminal tail that participates in binding of many structural and motor MT-associated proteins, is believed to be crucial for the functional adaptation of MTs. Polyglutamylation is catalyzed by a family of specific enzymes and in addition to tubulin can be found in some other proteins. 131

Many RNA viruses have adopted a strategy to modify the 5′ end of their genome by the covalent attachment of a peptide or the introduction of a cap moiety to ensure efficient translation, to protect their RNA from degradation by cellular 5′-3′ exonucleases, and to avoid detection as foreign RNA (which can trigger an innate immune response) 20 . Through a non-conventional cytoplasmic capping mechanism, alphaviruses synthesize the minimal RNA cap chemical structure, named cap-0 (m 7 GpppNp-RNA, in which N is the first nucleotide of the viral RNA, p represents a phosphate and m represents a methyl group) 20 . Several reactions are required for the synthesis of the alphavirus cap structure. The N7 position of GTP is first methylated by the methyltransferase activity of nsP1 using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl-donor. Next a covalent m 7 GMP-nsP1 complex is formed from which the m 7 GMP is transferred to the viral RNA. The amino acid binding covalently to m 7 GMP has never been characterized directly, but histidine 37 has been proposed as the best candidate 18, 21, 22 . Before guanylyltransfer to the viral RNA can occur, the 5′ gamma-phosphate of the nascent viral RNA chain is removed by an RNA 5′-triphosphatase residing in the nsP2 protein 23, 24 .

The transmission power and receiver sensitivity are set to the default ns-3 values, which correspond to common WiFi settings. The MANET routing protocol is OLSR. Proactively building the routing tables is, in fact, essential for the correct functioning of the UAV-enabled LoRa network mobility algorithm, since the information they contain is used to compute various important parameters. The impact of the routing protocol on the performance of the system has not been investigated as part of this work, but it is reasonable to expect that, at least in highly mobile networks, any protocol that provides fast convergence of routes and frequent periodic table updates would benefit the UAV-enabled LoRa system. The simulation parameters and their values are provided in Table 2 . Note that the altitude of UAVs is set to 60 m above the ground, which corresponds to the maximum height of trees in temperate climates. This height is suitable for disaster-ridden areas where the taller infrastructures rarely exist. The terrain is considered flat and the GNs moves at a normal walking speed of 5 km/h which is commonly used in the literature [40] . Figure 5 shows the Average End-to-End Packet Reception Rate (AE-PRR) as a function of different values of K p . It is worth mentioning that the metric AE-PRR is the average percentage of unique packets sent by all GN and correctly received by the BS through the network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, we compare our approach with that of [24] . In the figure, our proposed approach is shown as a solid line, whereas, the approach of [24] is illustrated as a dashed line. In general, it can be seen that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approach of [24] in terms of improved AE-PRR. In addition to this, it can be noticed that the number of teams influences the range of K p values that gives the best results in terms of AE-PRR. As an example, with only 4 teams and 12 UAVs, the best results are obtained with K p in the range [20, 30] , while with 5 teams and 12 UAVs the best range becomes [30, 40] . In general, we can observe that a bigger number of GNs requires bigger K p values. Another immediate and obvious consequence of adding more GNs is the decrease of the maximum achievable AE-PRR, which passes from around 0.9 with one team to almost 0.65 with five teams. Furthermore, one can observe that the difference between the packet reception rate of the proposed solution and that of [24] grows for a larger number of UAVs in the network. This is one of the most critical aspects of the proposed solution is that the high packet loss might be too penalizing for a critical application. Even when just 60 GNs divided into three teams are deployed and 12 UAVs are used, the packet loss is above 20%. This is the drive that brought to the development of the CRM and MP algorithms. K p is not only influenced by the number of teams, but also by the number of GNs per team, as it is possible to observe in Figure 6 . The figure shows the AE-PRR of two simulation scenarios: one having 3 teams of 10 GNs and the other having 3 teams of 40 GNs. Compared with the results reported in Figure 5 , in the scenario with only 10 GNs per team, the system behaves better with a lower K p (range [5, 10] ). On the contrary, in the scenario with 40 GNs per team, the system performs better with a higher K p (range [45, 50] ). This shows that a higher density of GNs moving in the same area requires bigger values of K p to obtain the best AE-PRR results. It is also interesting to study the trend of the Average Total Delay (ATD) which is expressed as the average delay of packets sent by GNs to the BS through UAVs. Specifically, it is the sum of the delay experienced in the LoRaWAN network segment and in the WiFi network segment while it also includes the delay caused by buffered packets. In this regard, a plot is shown in Figure 7 for three teams of GNs. The ATD decreases with the number of UAVs and with bigger values of K p . To understand this behavior, it is necessary to remember that the ATD is computed only on packets that are successfully received by the BS and it takes into account also the time that a packet eventually spends in the buffer. Therefore, in scenarios with few UAVs, the mesh is more subject to disconnections and the bigger number of buffered packets contributes in large part to the big delay. Disconnections and buffering time also explains why lower delays are associated with bigger values of K p : a big K p favors the compactness of the aerial mesh to the detriment of the coverage. This is confirmed by the decreasing trend of the average percentage of buffered packets shown in Figure 8 , which is an indication of the probability of disconnections in the mesh. K p must, therefore, be chosen as a compromise between the desired coverage and delay. The analysis of the other QoS metrics produces some minor observations. In conclusion, K p proved to be an important parameter that greatly influences the performance of the system. It has, therefore, to be chosen properly depending on the number of UAVs, the number of teams and the number of GNs per team. Configuring K p might be complex in a real system, due to the numerous variables that must be taken into account. A future study of a K p optimization routine is, therefore, necessary to simplify the configuration process.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the etiological agent responsible for MERS, a severe respiratory disease first reported in the Middle East in 2012 [25] . So far, MERS patients have mainly been identified in and near the Arabian Peninsula. However, there have also been many cases in other countries in travelers who had visited the Arabian Peninsula [8, 11, 22] . This virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact with infected individuals [1] . The detection of MERS-CoV RNA and the high seroprevalence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in dromedary camels in the Middle East raise the possibility that these animals may be natural/ amplification hosts preceding human infection [16, 21] . Genetically, MERS-CoV resembles the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the causative agent for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease that occurred in humans in [2002] [2003] . Therefore, the spread of MERS-CoV infection has raised serious concerns for a potential global pandemic.

Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and her oxygen saturation values were 94% to 100% while breathing ambient air. The heart rate fluctuated between 120 and 140 beats per minute. The laboratory examinations on hospital day 10 showed elevated myocardial zymogram and abnormal liver function both recovered. On hospital day 11 (illness day 16), a third chest CT scan showed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity were obviously absorbed ( Figure 1C ). In view of the patient's clinical manifestations and other laboratory findings, the Citrobacter freundii in 2 sputum cultures was considered as a colonized bacteria of the respiratory tract and was not being treated. Three pharyngeal swabs obtained from hospital day 10 to hospital day 13 were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assays. Amoxicillin potassium clavulanate was discontinued on hospital day 11, and interferon α-1b was discontinued on the following day. According to the latest interim guidance of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment in China, the patient met the discharge criteria. However, we found that her anal swabs collected on hospital day 11 and 13 were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thus, the patient remained hospitalized. From February 16, 2020, she was transferred to another hospital for continued isolation and observation. In the process of manuscript revision, we have learned that she was still asymptomatic during this period, and the anal swab collected on February 28, 2020 was negative for this viral RNA.

In December, 2019, hospitals in Wuhan, China began to report cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. Most of the initially identified patients were geographically linked to a local wet seafood wholesale market, where living or slaughtered wild animals are sold. The virus then rapidly spread to over 200 countries and territories, resulting in 3 672 238 confirmed cases and 254 045 deaths globally according to a report released by WHO on May 7, 2020. Subsequent deep sequencing of lower respiratory tract samples identified a novel coronavirus distinct from the other strains of coronavirus known to infect humans, subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-a highly contagious virus that can be transmitted from person to person. 1 WHO designated the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Similar to other diseases caused by coronaviruses, the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is via aerosolised droplets. Other possible transmission routes such as direct contact, oral-faecal route, and mother-tochild transmission have been proposed, but further proof is needed with regard to these. 2 A retro spective study done at the beginning of the pandemic reported an incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 of approximately 5-14 days; 3 however, a more recent report indicates that the incubation period could be as long as 24 days. 4 There is no effective cure for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the most common treatment for patients with COVID-19 is support ive care. Although multiple anti-viral drugs, including remdesivir and lopinavir plus ritonavir, have been used in clinical practice, 5,6 the safety and efficacy of these are still unclear and are under clinical evaluation. Immune-mediated lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. 7 Histological examination of lung biopsy tissue from a patient who died of COVID-19 showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage and fibroblastic proliferation in airspaces, and laboratory tests indicated a hyper activated status of circulating CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes. 7, 8 Due to the hyperactive nature of the immune system in some patients with severe COVID-19, several disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as tocilizumab (interleukin [IL]-6 receptor inhibitor), baricitinib (Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor), anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist), and the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine), have been proposed as potential treatments for COVID- 19 . In this Review, we discuss the immunological aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the potential implication of DMARDs in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

The control of the route of transmission is another effective means of epidemic control. Infections of healthcare workers and family clusters suggest that 2019-nCoV has the ability to spread from human to human. Although the seafood market has been closed, the number of confirmed cases continues to gradually increase ( Fig. 1 B) . This further supports the conclusion that this virus can spread by human-to-human contact. Previous research has shown that coronaviruses usually have an ability to rapidly mutate. 9 We cannot exclude the possibility that some 2019-nCoVs will mutate to become "super-spreaders", as seen in SARS. Frequent disinfection of people-intensive places and animal trading markets should help stop the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, the outbreak has cast a shadow over the celebrations for the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25. Millions of people in China travel over the course of the Spring Festival, both within the country and overseas. In addition, millions of college students (Wuhan has more than 1 million college students) will return to school after the winter vacation. This large-scale population migration could lead to further spread of this virus. Therefore, it is possible that this epidemic will be more serious after the Spring Festival. At present, the National Health Commission of China ( http://www.nhc.gov.cn ) has listed 2019-nCoV as Class B infectious disease and managed as Class A. Measures including the temperature monitoring of passengers at railway stations, airports, terminals and other transportation hubs have been carried out, which should slow the spread of the virus to a certain extent. However these disease control policies are far from enough, more strict methods to control population flow should be on the table.

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a major concern of the potential for not only an epidemic but a pandemic. Although most of the cases are still occurring in Hubei province, China, there are some other epicenters developing in China. COVID-19 appears to be highly contagious. It is classified as a type of RNA virus, belonging to the family of coronaviruses, which primarily leads to a respiratory system infection. One of the primary findings for COVID-19 is pneumonia. [1] [2] [3] Although the exact origin of COVID-19 remains unknown, the first reported cases were all linked to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market where wild animals (such as bats) were sold illegally. [2] [3] [4] Evidence has also been found that it can be transmitted from human to human through respiratory droplets, contact and even via fecal-oral transmission. [3] [4] [5] [6] Although control measures have been applied to prevent further spread in China, including isolation of people suspected to have the disease, the need for better diagnosis and treatment of patients with pneumonia is no longer limited to Wuhan, especially https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.016 0163-4453/© 2020 The British Infection Association.

A SEIR model assumes constant population. So, in this study, prior to the inter-state transportation of migrant workers, the standard SEIR model have additional compartment of migrant workers. This compartment of migrant workers does not interact with any of the SEIR model compartments shown in Figure 1 . However, when transportations for migrant workers are arranged, a suitable interaction between the compartment of migrant workers and some of the standard SEIR compartments is established. Hence, at the beginning the model parameters i.e., , , , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 and 1 are estimated considering the present state population without the returning migrant worker distributed among the , , , , , and compartments. A migrant worker not infected with COVID-19 can be part of compartment. However, the migrant workers are not tested for COVID-19, only symptoms are monitored prior to boarding a train or a bus. In this process, an asymptomatic person and exposed individual cannot be detected. So, an asymptomatic person and exposed individual can board the bus or train and might become symptomatic prior to disembarking. The probability of someone being symptomatic depends on the location or the state they are currently residing. If the probability of being symptomatic and quarantined, estimated by considering the ratio of quarantined population and the total population of the region, in a particular state is F , the number of expected symptomatic persons among the migrant worker population FI traveling from state to state is F × FI . Based on some recent test results, about twothird of the symptomatic population is expected to be asymptomatic. Further, an asymptomatic traveling in a confined coach of a train or bus can expose many co-passengers. Hence, an elevated value of F is considered to estimate the symptomatic number of migrant workers reaching state from state . These symptomatic migrant workers are expected to be quarantined (in hospital or quarantine center) at their destination state. The co-passengers from the same compartment of the symptomatic passenger might be quarantined as well. Otherwise, the migrant workers are expected to be in isolation for 14 days. The assumed situations of migrant worker at their origin and destination is shown in Figure 2 . So, when the migrant workers arrive at their destination state, the SEIR model of the destination state is updated by assigning the symptomatic migrant workers to the compartment, asymptomatic migrant to the compartment and remaining to the compartment. The updated SEIR model is shown in Figure 3 . Note the migrant worker population did not interact with any compartments of a standard SEIR model until the first arrival date. Time required to transport all migrant workers to their destinations will depend on the daily arrival rate of migrant workers. In this analysis, various daily arrival rates are considered for review and comparison. The states with significantly high in-and out-migration are considered in this study. It can be observed from Figure 5 that the states with higher number of in-migrants (i.e., the states where people migrated to) are Maharashtra, NCT of Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, and states with higher number of out-migrants (i.e., the states from where people migrated) are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. These states contribute more than 50% of the in-and out-migrants population of India. The number of inand out-migrants forecasted for these states, for the year 2020, are shown in Table 2 . It is assumed that the migrants residing for more than four years in a state probably have permanently settled in that state. It is also considered that despite the pandemic COVID-19, these migrants would prefer staying at their current location. Therefore, the migrant worker expected to travel is derived from the people migrated in the last four years. Further, the approximate data of migrant workers willing to travel to their home state are verified from the local government's policies related to the migrant workers, news, and social media.

It is critical to characterize and understand new and emerging viruses, particularly in the context of zoonosis, whether transmitted from animal to man or man to animal. Coronaviruses, considered the most frequent source of the common cold in humans, are also widely dispersed throughout mammalian and avian populations. They have shown an ability to jump species, resulting in mild to serious zoonotic disease threats. The current ACoV genomic data provides strong evidence of an evolutionary relationship between HCoV-229E and AcoV. Whether the virus represents a recent cross-species transmission or a more distant transmission between humans and alpacas is yet to be determined. It would be interesting to analyze South American HCoV-229E isolates that were obtained in different years to determine the genetic similarities to the ACoV. This line of investigation might shed more light on the possibility of human to alpaca or alpaca to human transmission events and help to calculate when such an event might have occurred.

The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV, or SARS-CoV-2) has caused an epidemic of the acute respiratory syndrome known as COVID-19 in humans. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to multiple regions of China and multiple other countries, posing a serious threat to public health. The spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 may use the same host cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is much higher than that of ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV S protein, explaining why SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we report that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, or by the stimulation with inflammatory cytokines such as interferons. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 may positively induce its cellular entry receptor, ACE2, to accelerate its replication and spread; high inflammatory cytokine levels increase ACE2 expression and act as high-risk factors for developing COVID-19, and the infection of other viruses may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, drugs targeting ACE2 may be developed for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of coronaviruses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

The World Heath Organization (WHO) designated the causative agent as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was identified by the Chinese authorities. Because Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province and the 7th largest city China and the largest transport hub in the central part of China, it transports millions of people to lots of cities in China and many countries in the world everyday. Based on the special location and transport hub of Wuhan, the Chinese government has revised the law provisions of infectious diseases to add the novel 2019-nCoV as class A agent on January 20th 2020. Moreover, a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented, say, rigorous isolation of symptomatic, suspected person, 14 days of isolation for the people who traveled from one city to another, strictly prohibit the travel in the many provinces (especially the Hubei province), the public transport is partially shut down in lots of cities, etc. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these interventions during the early stage is questionable. So far, there are more than 8000 confirmed cases in Wuhan and more than 24000 confirmed cases in China, and the cumulative confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV from January 23rd to February 4th in Wuhan and mainland China are shown in Figure 1 (a) and Figure 1 (b) respectively. In addition, several exported cases have been confirmed in many other countries including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, USA, Canada, Germany, France, UK, Spain, etc. The WHO has recognized that the mathematical models of epidemic play a significant role in informing evidence-based decisions by health decision and policy makers. In order to determine the impact of prevention and control of infection in different positions (i.e. provinces and cities), the strength and duration of isolation, the value for the rate of recovery, we propose a novel dynamic system with time delay and external source in this paper. With the help of this novel system, we are able to not only predict the trend for the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in different districts of China but also provide some helpful suggestions to achieve the maximal protection of population with the minimal interruption of social-economic activities.

A dataset was constructed to examine Vietnamese student's learning habits during the time schools were suspended due to the novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), in response to a call for interdisciplinary research on the potential effects of the coronavirus pandemic (Elsevier, 2020). The questionnaires were spread over a network of educational communities on Facebook from February 7 to February 28, 2020. Using the snowball sampling method, researchers delivered the survey to teachers and parents to provide formal consent before they forwarded it to their students and children. In order to measure the influence of students’ socioeconomic status and occupational aspirations on their learning habits during school closures, the survey included three major groups of questions: (1) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status, school type, and occupational aspirations; (2) Student's learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (3) Students’ perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. There was a total of 920 clicks on the survey link, but only 460 responses accompanied by consent forms were received. Non-credible answers (e.g., year of birth after 2009, more than 20 hours of learning per day) were eliminated. The final dataset included 420 valid observations.

In this case, Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus 30 sinicus) are the most probable origin and pangolin (Manis 31 javanica) as an intermediate host (Li et al., 2020) . 32 The asymptomatic incubation period of the virus is estimated 33 to be between 2 and 12 days; however, up to 24 days incubation 34 period was reported in some studies (C.C. Lai et al., 2020) . The 35 most common symptoms of coronavirus disease are fever, tired-36 ness, dry cough and shortness of breath. More than 80% of cases 37 are mild and recover from the disease without needing special 38 treatment. However, around 15% of cases are categorised as 39 severely ill and the remaining 5% are categorised as critically 40 ill. In severe and critical cases, acute respiratory disease can lead 41 to pneumonia, kidney failure, and even death. 42 Although it is still early to determine the case fatality ratio 43 (CFR); today it is estimated to be over 4.5% (WHO, 2020b transmission is now believed to be mainly via saliva associated 52 respiratory droplets and contact transmission. However, fecal-53 oral transmission is possible as SARS-CoV-2 was identified in 54 the stool of patients (Holshue et al., 2020) . 55 Vertical transmission (from mothers to their new-borns) 56 however, is not yet confirmed (H. Chen et al., 2020) . More-57 over, aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also 58 plausible as the virus can remain viable and infectious in aero-59 sols for at least three hours and on surfaces for days (van 60 Doremalen et al., 2020) .

Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses and six species of Coronaviruses are known to cause human disease such as cause common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. In January 2020, scientists in Wuhan, China isolated a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for an outbreak of unknown pneumonia that had not been previously reported among humans. This virus spreads from person to person, through respiratory droplets, close contact, and by touching surfaces or objects contaminated by the virus. The incubation period varies between 2 days and 14 days. Symptoms usually include fever, cough, difficulty in breathing, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome. Older age and co-morbid conditions increase the fatality. Any person with a history of travel to and from COVID-19 affected countries in the past 14 days or any person who has had close contact with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 are suspect cases and needs evaluation. Currently no vaccine is available and treatment is mainly supportive. Measures at workplace should include- avoiding non-essential travel, identifying and isolating sick employees at the earliest, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, environmental hygiene and social distancing.

There are also some limitations to this study. First, we have no access to the data on the number of persons that traveled from Wuhan to other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province, so it is hard for us to exactly predict the size of the COVID-19 epidemic, and we only yielded the best fitting lag length of 11-12 days and concluded that the city lockdown in Hubei could help control the epidemic. Second, the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases reflect the cases detected rather than the cases infected, Appendix 1 so there may be measuring errors because not every COVID-19 case can be immediately confirmed. In this case, the influence of population mobility on the COVID-19 epidemic may be underestimated. Finally, many other factors were not considered in this study when analyzing the impact of city lockdown. For example, the COVID-19's prevention and control measures in many regions have been gradually upgraded, which also greatly promotes the arrival of the turning point of the epidemic. However, the sample size of this study was relatively small, the statistical power was moderate, and some confounding factors were hard to control. Therefore, although the results from the RE model (11-12 days) and the first derivative model (9-12 days) are similar, the judgment of the turning point of the epidemic only has moderate reference value and should be treated with caution.

Several zoonotic spillover infections or epidemics in humans are explained by the involvement of intermediate hosts, creating additional complexity when analyzing multihost species of viruses. In cases in which the virus establishes long-term endemicity in intermediate hosts, intermediate hosts can become natural hosts according to the above definition. The viruses existing in the primordial host and the intermediate host can both belong to the same species, but the viral source population involved in zoonotic transmission may be disconnected from that in the primordial host. For clarity of source implications, we will therefore refer to source species in zoonotic transmission processes as zoonotic sources, irrespective of whether they also fulfill all criteria of natural hosts. A prominent example is rabies virus that has highly diversified conspecifics in bats but is enzootic in dogs to such a degree that dogs are considered zoonotic sources and natural hosts at the same time, but not primordial hosts. The transmission of Nipah and Hendra virus (belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae) from bats to humans involves swine or horses that act as zoonotic sources but are not considered natural hosts because they are only accidentally infected (Eaton et al., 2006) . Intermediate hosts may act as zoonotic sources for dead-end hosts not only because they close gaps of contact between species, but also because they could make the virus transmissible by intermediary adaptation (Caron et al., 2015; Plowright et al., 2015) . Intermediary adaptation was strongly suspected for the SARS-CoV whose zoonotic source is in carnivores, in which the virus would have evolved human-compatible receptor tropism Guan et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2004) . However, viruses directly infecting human cells have later been found in rhinolophid bats, the primordial natural host of the species SARS-related CoV Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015) . Of note, these viruses are conspecific with SARS-CoV but do not fall into the viral clade that was transferred from carnivores to humans and initiated the epidemic. The actual ancestors of the SARS-CoV may continue to exist in the natural reservoir, as new virus variants are continuously formed in the reservoir. If the natural host (e.g., a bat species) harbors different virus populations of the same species, recombination contributes new variants. The proofreading and repair mechanisms typical in CoVs may aid the survival and selection of recombinant viruses in populations (Eckerle et al., 2010; Hanada et al., 2004; Minskaia et al., 2006) . Indeed, recombination between the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike gene has been discussed as one of the major mechanism involved in the emergence of human SARS-CoV strains from bat and civet ancestors (Eckerle et al., 2010) . On the other hand, ongoing recombination maintains stability of the gene pool of a defined virus species by shuffling sequences and thus limiting divergence processes (Lukashev, 2010) .

However , the heme can be transferred from DHasA to a HasA monomer .	The HasA protein is used by pathogenic bacteria to acquire the host's iron from either free heme or heme-containing hemoglobin. The secreted protein binds heme in a 1:1 stoichiometry and transfers it its receptor HasR, which in turn releases it into the bacterium. 157 Serratia marcescens HasA is a 19-kDa protein whose monomer structure is composed of seven b strands arranged into a central six-stranded antiparallel b sheet with a high degree of curvature. Four a helices are packed on one side against this sheet, whereas a loop connecting strands b 5 and b 6 covers its hydrophobic other side. Two small 3 10 helices connect strand b 7 to helix a 2 . The heme is held in a relatively solvent-exposed environment by two loops, one of which connects helix a 1 to strand b 2 and the other connects strands b 4 and b 5 at the interface of the predominately a and b regions of the molecule. 158 In addition to the monomeric variant, a HasA dimer (DHasA) is also secreted in vivo, and its crystal structure revealed a domain-swapped dimer. The pseudo-monomeric portion of the structure is very similar to the isolated monomer structure (Figure 16 ). However, it appears to be less flexible, and the region around the heme binding pocket is almost inaccessible in the dimer. 61 DHasA is not capable of transferring the heme to HasR because the appropriate productive HasA-HasR complex cannot be formed. Indeed, the regions involved in the interaction between HasA and HasR 159 become partially inaccessible by dimerization in DHasA. However, the heme can be transferred from DHasA to a HasA monomer. 61 Therefore, DHasA was proposed to constitute a heme reservoir, keeping it available for use by the Has system. 61

It is clear that in both countries the recommended measures of social distancing and closing the public gatherings are giving the results; the 'peak' of new infections, admissions to hospitals and deaths already happened in both countries. We think that our dynamical model based on compartment SIR epidemiological model with modifications from Markov chain and network flow are giving the tool to those who want to optimize the management of resources especially in other than central areas. It is of importance since our results are also showing that another wave of infections is possible and that we would probably have another peak(s).

In traditional compartmental models paradigm in epidemiology, SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) [3] and SEIR (Susceptible -Exposure-Infectious-Recovered) [4] are two popular approaches to stimulate and predict how infectious disease is transmitted from human to human. These two models have defined several variables that represent the number of people in each compartment at a particular time. As implied by the variable function of time, these models are dynamic to reflect the changes and fluctuations of these numbers in each compartment over time. As for the investigation of public health interventions for COVID-19 control in Wuhan, Zhong, et.al [6] introduced a modified SEIR model in prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in China, where the results show that under strong public intervention of "lockdown Hubei", the epidemic of COVID-19 in China would achieve peak by late February and gradually decline by the end of April 2020. Some other extended models [8] [12] are also proposed for predicting the epidemics of COVID-19 in Wuhan and give some similar forecasts. While above methods demonstrate good performance in prediction of COVID-19 breakout by taking strong public intervention, also named as suppression strategy [13] that aims to reverse epidemic growth, one important challenge is that taking suppression strategy only is to treat disease controls as single-objective optimisation of reducing the overall infectious populations as soon as possible, and require strategic consistency in a long term. In real-world, taking public health intervention strategies is actually a multiple-objective optimisation problem including economic loss and society impacts. Thus, most countries have taken different intervention strategies, like enhanced surveillance and isolation to affected individuals in Singapore [14] , four-stage response plan of the UK [15] , mitigation approaches [13] and even multiple interventions taken in many EU countries. Due to the fact that standalone intervention strategy has apparent merits and limitations, it becomes highly necessary to study the feasibility of intervention strategies to certain country in light of its multiple natures and capabilities.

It has become crucial to help diagnose such images using image processing methods. Therefore, we proposed a novel intelligent computer vision method to automatically detect the Covid-19 virus. The proposed automatic Covid-19 detection method consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and feature selection stages. Image resizing and grayscale conversion are used in the preprocessing phase. The proposed feature generation method is called as Residual Exemplar Local Binary Pattern (ResExLBP). In the feature selection phase, a novel iterative ReliefF (IRF) based feature selection is used. Decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighborhood (kNN) and subspace discriminant (SD) methods are chosen as classifiers in the classification phase. Leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) and 10-fold cross-validation are used for training and testing. In this work, SVM classifier achieved 100.0% classification accuracy by using 10-fold cross-validation. This result clearly has shown that we reached the perfect classification rate by using X-ray image for Covid-19 detection.

Diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) can occur with this virus [6] . Thus, it causes acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress. This situation poses a serious risk to public health [7] . As of 24 March 2020, 382,057 people were infected worldwide and 16,565 of these cases resulted in death. The total infection rate was seen as 2.5% [8] . Given the mortality rates of all cases, Covid-19 appears to be the most threatening to the elderly population and those with chronic health problems [9] . This virus is transmitted from person to person through coughing, sneezing, respiratory droplets. This virus, which usually presents with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, can have serious consequences such as pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death [6, 10] .

BACKGROUND: An epidemic of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus has spread from the Guangdong province to the rest of China and to the world, with a puzzling contagion behavior. It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. RESULTS: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. CONCLUSION: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reflect an appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a pandemic that is causing thousands of deaths worldwide. The virus can be transmitted from person to person, directly or indirectly, via the respiratory, oro-fecal and probably sexual routes.1 The eventual vertical transmission route is still poorly explored. However, mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the placenta probably does not occur, or likely occurs very rarely.2 All the studies conducted on COVID-19 pregnant women involved patients undergoing cesarean section, but the indications for such delivery modality were not clearly stated.

Case reports showed that a small fraction of neonates born to women with COVID-19 tested positive for the virus at 1-4 days of life [51, 52] ; yet, these neonates subsequently tested negative on day 6-7 [51] . In addition, serological studies revealed that a few neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had increased concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig)M as well as IgG [53, 54] . The elevated concentrations of IgG are likely due to the passive transfer of this immunoglobulin from the mother to the fetus across the placenta. However, the increased levels of IgM suggest that the fetus was infected with SARS-CoV-2 since this immunoglobulin cannot cross the placenta due to its large molecular weight. Nonetheless, all neonates included in the above-mentioned studies tested negative for the virus and did not present any symptoms [53, 54] .

SARS Coronavirus-2 is a newly discovered mysterious pathogen and there are no appropriate drugs and/or vaccines yet for its treatments. So, in order to find out effective methods for prevention and control of SARS Coronavirus-2 disease, it is indispensable for the physicians and biologists to understand the disease mechanisms in the human. However, SARS coronavirus-2 is such type of virus which first transmitted from animal to human. When it has been transmitted to human, then it continues to be transmitted through human to human by the closed contact of infected individuals due to its highly infectiveness. In the present study we highlight only human to human transmission. So, the whole dynamics of SARS Coronavirus-2 disease (COVID-19) can be described by a SIRS type infectious disease model in terms of a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (NODEs

Similar to the possible situation in coronaviruses, the emergence of influenza A viruses in a new host population seems, at least in part, to be mediated by virus-receptor interactions, although other factors are almost certainly involved. The main reservoir of influenza A viruses is the aquatic birds of the world, from which viruses sporadically transmit to other hosts in whom they can adapt and form stable lineages. Influenza viruses from avian and human sources preferentially bind different forms of the virus receptor on the host cell, namely, sialic acid. Avian influenza viruses have a preference for sialic acid that is linked to the galactose unit in a α2-3 conformation, whereas human viruses preferentially bind those with a α2-6 linkage 10,11 . This binding preference makes biological sense when one considers the host environment in which these viruses grow. The gastrointestinal tract of avian species contains predominantly α2-3-linked sialic acid, in contrast to the abundance of α2-6 linkages in the human respiratory tract.

Viruses related to simian virus 5 (parainfluenza virus 5) have been detected in humans, but the role of CPiV as a human pathogen is controversial. Reoviruses have a broad host range, and human infection has been associated with enteritis and respiratory disease; MRV-3 infection was associated with meningitis in a child.64 Thus they represent a potential zoonosis. Although adenoviruses, influenza viruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses cause respiratory disease in humans, there is no evidence that CAV-2, CIV, CDV, CHV-1, or CRCoV can be transmitted to humans. Human influenza viruses such as H1N1 can cause disease in dogs and may have the potential to spread from infected dogs back to humans.CASE EXAMPLESignalment“Winnie”, a 10-year old male neutered miniature Schnauzer from Sacramento, CAHistoryWinnie was brought to his local veterinarian because of a 1-day history of serous ocular and nasal discharge, and sneezing. Fever (103.5°F or 39.7°C) was documented on physical examination, and enrofloxacin (2 mg/kg PO q24h), bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin ophthalmic ointment (both eyes q8h), and diphenhydramine (2.2 mg/kg PO q12h) were prescribed, without clinical improvement. A day later, he became lethargic, inappetent, and polydipsic, and the owners described continuous nasal discharge, and a moist cough. Winnie was brought to the UC Davis VMTH for a second opinion. He had been vaccinated regularly for CDV, CAV-2, CPV, rabies, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and CPiV. He was recently cared for in a boarding facility for a week and had been home for the past 11 days. He also regularly visited dog parks.

Cervical radiographs were unremarkable. The pulmonary changes were considered nonspecific, but more significant than those expected due to age.Abdominal UltrasoundThe cranial pole of the right adrenal was mildly to moderately enlarged. The liver appeared sonographically normal. A 3 mm stone was identified in the urinary bladder.Microbiologic TestingA nasal swab specimen was submitted for real-time PCR panel for canine respiratory pathogens, which included CHV-1, CIV, CDV, CPiV, CAV-2, and B. bronchiseptica. The results were available 3 days later, and the specimen was positive for CHV-1 DNA.DiagnosisUpper respiratory disease and keratitis associated with CHV-1 infection.TreatmentWinnie was hospitalized in isolation and treated with 0.9% NaCl (30 mL/hr IV), nebulization for 15 min q8h, clavulanic acid-amoxicillin (13.5 mg/kg PO q12h), and lubricating eye ointment (1 inch OU q4h). Clinical improvement occurred a day later, electrolyte abnormalities normalized, and the dog was discharged with instructions to administer topical idoxuridine (0.1% ophthalmic solution, 2 drops OU q4-6h). Unfortunately a caretaker of the dog did not regularly administer the idoxuridine. At a recheck 5 weeks after the dog was first seen, the owner reported 80% improvement in Winnie’s respiratory signs, but he continued to sneeze approximately six times a day and was pawing at his eyes. Examination revealed persistent conjunctivitis, and a fluorescein stain showed large, superficial areas of uptake over the central cornea OU (see Figure 17-2). A Schirmer tear test (STT) was 13 mm/min OS and 8 mm/min OD. A CBC was normal, and the serum biochemistry profile showed persistently increased ALP (835 U/L) and GGT activities (12 U/L) and improvement in the serum ALT activity (124 U/L). The owner was instructed to administer idoxuridine for an additional 2 weeks, as well as lubricating ointment, bacitracin-neomycin ophthalmic ointment (q8h OU), and l-lysine gel (2 mL [400 mg] q12h PO), separating the ophthalmic medications with administration of the idoxuridine first. At a recheck 2 weeks later, all signs had resolved and there was no fluorescein uptake. STT results were 14 mm/min OS and 10 mm/min OD. The idoxuridine was discontinued. Winnie had another episode of respiratory signs 4 months later, at which time the STT results were 15 mm/min OU. Treatment with lubricating eye ointment and l-lysine was continued.CommentsThis was an unusual case of ocular and respiratory herpesviral infection. The early detection of dendritic ulcers allowed a connection to be made between the clinical signs and positive PCR assay result. The negative PCR assay results for other respiratory pathogens did not rule out the possibility of co-infections, because shedding of these organisms may have ceased or been at undetectable levels. Although idoxuridine was used to treat this dog, topical cidofovir may also have been effective.50 Approximately 2 years later, mild serous nasal discharge and depigmentation of the planum nasale developed. A biopsy of the nasal planum showed epitheliotropic lymphoma. The dog was treated with multiagent chemotherapy for over a year without relapse of herpetic keratitis.

A novel coronavirus (CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), caused a worldwide epidemic of SARS with a fatality rate of 9.6% in 2002/03 and later reemerged and resulted in infection of four individuals with full recovery in the winter of 2003/04 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV has been demonstrated to be a zoonotic disease that evolved in palm civet and human hosts. The global outbreak that occurred in 2002/03 and the cluster of 2003/04 SARS cases were the result of two independent zoonotic transfers from palm civets to humans [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although palm civets were identified as the hosts involved in human transmission, evidence suggested the existence of another precursor reservoir. Indeed bats, predominantly horseshoe bats, were later found to be a natural reservoir of SARS-like-CoVs, and harbor more diverse viruses than any other hosts [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Variants of SARS-like-CoVs circulating in bats may cross the species barrier again and this threat is enhanced by the large numbers of bats that often congregate, their broad geographic distribution and their ability to travel long distances. Diversity of host range and variant immune pressures within the natural reservoir or intermediate hosts are likely to continue to drive SARS-CoV evolution.

The current outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebolavirus (EboV) have revealed a gap in the development and availability of drugs to treat these infections. To date, there are no approved treatments for patients infected with MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a virus that continues to infect new patients and that has now spread from the Middle East to Asia. Despite a downward trend in the number of new EboV cases in West Africa, new infections are still occurring, and many patients continue to suffer from this illness. People infected with MERS and Ebola viruses receive only supportive care in hopes of recovery. Investigation into repurposing drugs approved by the FDA is gaining interest. To identify better treatment strategies, several groups have used drug screens to repurpose FDA-approved drugs as inhibitors of MERS-CoV and EboV.

Since December 2019, cases with pneumonia of unknown cause have been reported in Wuhan, China [1] . A novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the infections, which is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans [1, 2] . Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory diseases and is capable of spreading from person to person. As of March 2 2020, there have been more than 87,000 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide, including more than 2900 deaths. Unfortunately, the development of effective vaccine against such novel virus would take a few months. Thus it is urgent to find some effective approved drugs that can be used quickly, which is "drug-repurposing". As a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA beta-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 encodes structural, non-structural and accessory proteins. Among these, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3-chymotrypsin-like (3CL) protease, papain-like protease, helicase and spike glycoprotein are supposed to be the main targets. Several compounds that targeted these viral proteins and inhibited coronavirus in vitro have been reported and moved into clinical trials [3] . For example, remdesivir is an approved HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which has broad-spectrum activities against RNA viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but showed less effective in a Ebola clinical trial [4] [5] [6] . Recent reports showed that remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with EC50=0.77μM [7] , and was used to treat a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient in the United States [8] .

At the end of December of 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was detected in adults with pneumonia from the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. This new virus rapidly spread from Hubei Province to all China [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . By January 22th the virus was detected in South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand. Macao and USA. By March 12 of 2020, 128,343 cases of new virus have been detected in 116 countries and 63% of the cases has been register in Continental China. In February 26, Brazil was the first country of Latin America to detect this virus and Mexico detect his first case one day later [6] . CoVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that has been widely studied in these recents weeks and we defer its description to the appropriate sources e.g. [4, 5] . The disease has been extensively modeled as a SEIR type of epidemic. In this work we use the SEIR model framework adapting it to the particular set of problems addressed here. In each section, dependent on the model variant used, we introduce the new parameters if any and refer to the appropriate section in the Appendix for the specific model equations. The rate ω or the related time 1/ω is the mean time of application of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). All the recommendations that are being advised to prevent infection affect behavior (washing hands, keeping cough/sneeze etiquette, avoiding handshakes, keeping distance from other people) and, therefore, have a learning curve and can be forgotten or relaxed or incompletely adopted in any given population; also q is the proportion of the population that is effectively put under isolation. For example, in Wuhan, about 60% of the population was put under isolation. The total population normally living in that region is of about 14 million but the population at risk was obviously larger comprising much of the Hubei region.

Among the RNA viruses affecting mammals, influenza viruses and coronaviruses represent, as a consequence of different molecular mechanisms, two of the best examples of viruses with exceptionally plastic genomes. Thus, we should not be surprised that the high mutation and reassortment rates have propelled the evolution of influenza viruses in pigs in recent years. However, from the first characterization of swine influenza virus until the late 1990s, the classical swine lineage H1N1 (cH1N1) was relatively stable at the genetic and antigenic levels in Fig. 1 Epidemiology and genetic composition of influenza viruses from U.S. and Canadian pigs. Swine virus lineage is color coded pink, avian lineage is coded green, human lineage is coded blue or purple. The chronology of transmission events leading to reassortant viruses with genes from swine, human and avian influenza virus lineages is visualized by the vertical arrow. The ''Spanish flu'' virus was transmitted from avian/human origin to pigs and evolved into the cH1N1, as indicated by the transition in color of pigs from blue to light blue to red to pink. The human and avian images to the left of the vertical timeline represent the species origin of viral gene segments donated to give rise to the swine influenza virus reassortants listed on the right side of the vertical timeline. Time line is not drawn to scale. Each viral subtype is represented with its eight gene segment arrangement. The triple reassortant H3N2 reassorted with the cH1N1 to produce rH1N1 and H1N2 subtypes with the triple reassortant internal gene (TRIG) cassette. Further reassortment events with two independent human H1 subtype viruses led to the d1 H1N2 and d2 H1N1. The source of the reassortment event producing the combination of gene segments in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 prior to its emergence in human and subsequent transmission from humans to pigs in 2009 is currently unknown. Light green indicates the Eurasian avian/swine lineage. The gray highlighted area illustrates the currently circulating influenza A subtypes in Canadian and American pigs U.S. swine. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the cH1N1 lineage is closely related to the 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu virus (Easterday and van Reeth 1999) and other human influenza viruses isolated in the 1930s following the discovery of SIV. Although the cH1N1 was the predominant subtype causing disease in pigs until the late 1990s, there was serological evidence that human subtype H3 influenza viruses were circulating at a low frequency in U.S. pigs, but failed to establish a lineage with sustained transmission among swine (Chambers et al. 1991) .

There are two different approaches to probe design for the study of RNA splicing using DNA microarrays: (1) tiling and (2) exon arrays [22] (Fig. 6b) . In tiling arrays, the set of overlapping probes cover the full length of the nascent primary transcript including exons and introns. The analysis of fluorescence for each probe allows the identification of exons and introns based on the difference in signal intensity (Fig. 6bi) . The advantage of tiling arrays is their ability to identify known splice . When bound to unspliced transcript, the binding sites of two probes are separated by intron preventing energy transfer by FRET, and thus, no signal is generated. After intron removal by RNA splicing, two probes are bought to proximity for FRET to occur. The energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor leads to excitation of the acceptor fluorophore (A in circle with spikes) and generation of detectable signal. The diagram is modified from Blanco and Artero [31] events as well as new splice events. Therefore, the tiling arrays are often used as discovery tools. The disadvantages are the requirement of a large amount of probes, which results in time-consuming data analysis. The exon arrays are more commonly used but require the knowledge of splicing events. Several types of probes hybridizing to flanking exons, intron, and exon-exon junctions are designed to detect each splicing event (Fig. 6bii) . The fluorescence intensity is detected for each probe, and a mathematical model is applied to determine the occurrence of splicing event. The advantage of exon arrays is the smaller number of probes required, which means simpler data analysis. However, the exon arrays detect only known or predicted splicing variants. Due to their large capacities, the exon arrays can be designed to detect splicing in multiple viral pathogens simultaneously.

Bats and pangolins have been suggested to have links with SARS-CoV-2 [12, 53, 64, 71, 79, 93, 100, 124, 133] . Recently, some domestic animals, such as dogs and cats in different European and Asian countries, have been found infected as a consequence of their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infected human owners [81, [137] [138] [139] . Besides, a study performing experimental infections with SARS-CoV-two found cats and ferrets to be susceptible to this virus [81, 107] . Other felines, such as tigers and lions in New York, USA, have been found infected, also a consequence of their interaction with infected workers in one zoological park of the city [81, [137] [138] [139] . These pieces of evidence suggest a potential anthropozoonotic transmission and animal receptivity for the virus as a result of reverse zoonosis. Taking into account the higher similarity between the spike glycoprotein of current virus (SARS-CoV-2) and previous coronaviruses, a study hypothesised the role of "unconventional" biological hosts. Notably, in their observations, mild infection of COVID-19 was seen outside the Wuhan, China with better recovery of patients and was suggestive of some past as anosmia and ageusia, have been reported [82] . The unique symptom reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection is the involvement of the gastrointestinal system, which was not found in the case of SARS and MERS [136] . Additionally, the presence of viral RNA in the faecal samples of the COVID-19 patients suggests probable transmission by the faecal-oral route [48] . Recent evidence indicates that even asymptomatic patients may be unaware of their SARS-CoV-2 infection status and can, therefore, transmit the virus from faeces to others unknowingly if they are not isolated for medical observation [54] .

All these seroprevalence data and global viral prevalence around 3% at Care Houses in Galicia (Spain), reported in the present study, suggest that the virus circulation rate has been low in our area. Therefore, the number of people at risk of acquiring the infection continue to be very high. In the current de-escalation stage, different COVID-19 containment strategies will be needed. Previous studies have studied how the SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person and the contribution of different sources of virus infection. The role of presymptomatic people: It has been estimated that up to 47% of infections happen from presymptomatic individuals, 40% from symptomatic individuals, 10% from the environment and 6% from asymptomatic people who never show symptoms [14] in line with others studies [15] [16] . To control the spread of the virus, it is essential to detect as many infected individuals as possible, as quickly as possible to trace down and test possible contacts [17] . To this end, it is important to detect presymptomatic patients and increase the number of people tested. In this context, sample pooling strategies can substantially increase the diagnostic capacity of laboratories and help to improve infection control.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has declared the novel Corona virus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. It is essential to understand how coronavirus transmits from one person to another and this knowledge will help protect the vulnerable and limit the spread of the Corona virus. The mode of respiratory transmission of Corona virus is not completely understood as of date. Using a computer simulation, this paper analyses the probability of spreading of Corona virus through air among the people who are standing in a queue. The parameters such as the diameter of the virus particle, room temperature, relative humidity, height of the person, distance between the people and the waiting time in the queue are considered in the computer model to determine the distribution of Corona virus and hence identify the risk factor of spreading the Covid-19. This paper describes the possibilities of getting infectious when a Covid-19 infected person present in a queue and the impact on the waiting time and the position in the queue on the transmission of Corona virus.

[ 21 ] have also suggested that not only the vaccine strains but also a possible infectious IBV strain may be transmitted from poultry to birds of other species .	Evidence of infections by the IBV vaccine virus or the infectious IBV strain to birds of other species has been reported before. Reverse spillover of the vaccine virus from domesticated birds to wild birds has been proposed by Devlin et al. [5] and Rohaim et al. [26] . Our results were similar to the previous study by Ito et al. [18] , which discovered that IB-like coronavirus from peafowl has close genetic relatedness with the IBV H120 vaccine strain. This previous study also showed that the vaccine strain may infect non-chicken birds and may have few mutations that, upon infection to chickens, do not inflict disease. Liu et al. [21] have also suggested that not only the vaccine strains but also a possible infectious IBV strain may be transmitted from poultry to birds of other species. For example, cross-transmission of nephropathogenic IBV virus occurred in teal housed near domesticated poultry [21] . This means that IBV can infect a variety of bird species. In a possible case where infected birds are wild birds, these birds may act as a reservoir of the virus and spread it to other susceptible species [27] . Transmission of the virus to wild birds has likely happened due to poor biosecurity in poultry farms and contamination from improper disposal of litter and waste [5] . Most of the Indonesian poultry farmers still rely on an Open House Coop. A high density of birds without effective biosecurity and disease prevention increases the possibility of viral mutation [8] . Contamination from improper disposal of litter and waste may ease the transmission from domesticated poultry to wild birds. Spillover to wild birds is often overlooked, especially in terms of its ecological impact. This is especially important for endangered species. However, the epidemiology and effect of spillover from domesticated birds to wild birds are not yet fully understood, despite evidence of its occurrence.

A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the Internal Medicine Department of Chieti Hospital on 17 March 2020 with a 7-day history of both fever and cough. The patient's medical history included arterial hypertension and hypothyroidism. She underwent a chest x-ray, ultrasound of the thorax according to indications in the literature [4] , and a CT scan of the thorax with evidence of interstitial pneumonia and respiratory failure. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed mild hypoxemic hypocapnic respiratory failure, which was treated with 1 l/min of oxygen via a nasal cannula. The laboratory investigations demonstrated lymphocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein (245 mg/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (280 U/l). These findings suggested COVID-19. A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 taken at admission was positive, so darunavir/cobicistat 800/150 mg once a day plus hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day were initiated. The patient rapidly improved and after 5 days was afebrile. At the end of March, 2 weeks after admission, she was completely asymptomatic, and laboratory tests showed no lymphocytopenia and a large reduction in C-reactive protein from 245 to 7.6 mg/l. The respiratory failure had also resolved and radiology showed improvement with a reduction in signs of bilateral pneumonia. However, a nasopharyngeal swab was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 31 March. Although the patient had clinically recovered and had been transferred from our acute department to a unit for clinically stable patients, the nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 continued to be positive until the end of April (swabs taken in mid-April, 22 April and 30 April), an interval of around 51 days from the onset of symptoms on 10 March. This is the longest duration of positivity described in a European patient in the current literature.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious and typically rapidly progressive form of atypical pneumonia, which spread from Asia to many parts of the world in early 2003. Clinical diagnosis of SARS requires the presence of unremitting fever and progressive pneumonia despite antibiotic therapy, particularly in the presence of lymphopenia and raised transaminase levels. We report the case of a woman who had undergone a successful allogeneic bone marrow transplant for acute myeloid leukemia. She presented initially with fever and a normal chest radiograph. Her indolent clinical course of SARS was punctuated by resolution of fever, but there was progressive radiologic deterioration and increasing serum antibody titer against SARS coronavirus. Treatment with oral prednisolone and ribavirin normalized her lymphopenia, altered transaminases, chest radiograph and high-resolution computed tomography appearances rapidly. Our experience should alert other clinicians in recognizing this atypical indolent presentation of SARS, to protect health care workers and the community at large and to ensure that these patients are properly treated.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has caused serious worldwide epidemics. Because it is highly contagious, potentially life-threatening, and spreads rapidly, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization continue to closely monitor the SARS situation to strictly control its spread. Because it is an airborne disease, and is easily transmitted from person to person, several measures have been taken to prevent the recurrence of another SARS outbreak. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2002 and 2003 , there is growing demand for diagnostic tools for early, accurate, and safe laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV. Thus, the development and evaluation of specific and early detection of SARS-CoV may contribute to its risk management in the future. The 3 major diagnostic methods currently available are (i) viral RNA detection using real-time reverse-transcription PCR (Yam et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004) , (ii) antibody detection Li et al., 2005) , and (iii) antigen detection (Che et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005) . The most predominant SARS-CoV-derived protein throughout the infection is the nucleocapsid protein (NP) due to the comparatively high levels of mRNA expressed upon infection (Hiscox et al., 1995) . The NP is also reported to be high in humans infected with SARS-CoV. The NP of SARS-CoV exhibits low homology with other members of the coronavirus family (Marra et al., 2003) . This unique feature makes it a suitable candidate for developing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) for ultrasensitive SARS diagnostics. It has also been demonstrated that there is a significant amount of circulating shed NP antigen in serum samples from infected patients ranging from 100 pg/mL to 3.2 ng/mL. Detection of the NP antigen by ELISA was peaked at d 6 to 10 with 71% of patients being positive for the antigen (Che et al., 2004) . It has also been reported that the NP was detectable from SARS-CoV-infected patients in other body fluids, such as nasopharyngeal aspirate, urine, and fecal samples, collected between d 2 to 33 after the onset of symptoms Lau et al., 2004) .

MERS-CoV is present in ciliated bronchial epithelium, in terminal bronchial epithelium, and alveolar macrophages. 5 Aside from tissue culture, MERS-CoV may be diagnosed by ELISA, IFA, or microneutralization assay (MNT). The CDC has developed a real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR assay that is available worldwide to diagnose MERS. MERS-CoV is present in serum, feces, and urine but highest concentrations are in lower respiratory secretions. Previous exposure to SARS, i.e., anti-SARS-CoV antibodies appears to confer some protective immunity to MERS-CoV, i.e., less severe infections. [6] [7] [8] Epidemiology In June 2012 a novel β coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated from the respiratory tract of a fatal case of viral pneumonia in a Saudi businessman. Since that time, MERS has been reported in 20 countries. The spectrum of MERS ranges from a mild viral respiratory illness to a rapidly fatal viral pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute renal failure (ARF). There have been MERS outbreaks in health facilities and clusters within families and person-to-person transmission has been demonstrated. Household and nosocomial transmission may occur as well. 9, 10 At the present time, the pandemic potential for MERS appears low. While having a high case fatality rate, the transmissibility of MERS appears to be modest. In contrast, SARS had low case fatality rate but was highly transmissible. [11] [12] [13] Pandemic influenza is feared because the viral strains causing pandemic influenza (e.g., the 1918 H1N1 strain) can possess both the ability to rapidly transmit the influenza among humans and has a high fatality rate, particularly in young healthy adults. 14,15 Among the zoonotic viral pneumonias, avian influenza (H 7 N 9 ) has a comparable high fatality rate, and a high pandemic potential since the zoonotic vectors are migratory birds. 16 Outside of the Arabian Peninsula, MERS cases have been travel-related and traceable to the Arabian Peninsula. According to the CDC, the first United States case occurred on May 2, 2014 in Indiana. This first US case was a traveler from Saudi Arabia to Indiana via London and Chicago. The patient was a healthcare worker and lived and worked in Saudi Arabia. The second case of MERS occurred in Florida on May 11, 2014 and was also imported from a traveler from Saudi Arabia. This patient was also a healthcare worker who traveled to Florida from Saudi Arabia via London, Boston, and Atlanta. The third US case had casual contact with the initial Indiana case, raising questions about person-to-person spread. The probable third US case was diagnosed on the basis of positive ELISA and IFA with a negative MNT. According to the WHO another MERS case was reported in Jordan on May 25, 2014 in a 69-y-old male. He was initially hospitalized for a surgical procedure and subsequently discharged. After 5 d he developed fever and was readmitted to the same hospital 3 d later. After 2 d in hospital, he developed a cough and chest radiograph showed pneumonia. MERS was suspected but MERS testing was negative. He remains critically ill in the ICU 10 d after the initial MERS testing. A second specimen was taken that was positive for MERS.

On November 2002, 305 cases of atypical pneumonia appeared in southern China. In February 2003, cases were reported in Hong Kong and from there the disease spread to many other countries, mainly, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Toronto in Canada. The syndrome was defined as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS), and a person is suspected of having SARS if he/she became ill after November 1 2002, has a fever exceeding 38 degrees C, has symptoms of a respiratory disease and was in a risk area or in close contact with a SARS patient within ten days prior the appearance of symptoms. The World Health Organization has received reports of 4,836 cases, of which 293 persons have died. Most were family members or medical staff treating the patient, persons who came into close and prolonged contact with the patient. The estimated incubation period is two days to one week. Symptoms of the disease include fever, shortness of breath and cough. Ten percent of patients afflicted with SARS require artificial breathing. The mortality rate is 6-7%. A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Infection is transmitted from person to person through direct or close contact with airborne droplets or personal objects of an infected person. Patients must be isolated and treated by contact and airborne isolation. Treatment consists of support care and artificial respiration when required. The use of anti-viral medications has not yet proven effective.

The high degree of similarity between s2m from non-related virus families indicates that s2m has a common origin. It is unlikely that s2m has coevolved with the rest of the genome of a single common ancestor virus, because this motif is present only in a limited number of viral species within the viral families where it has been found and because of the large evolutionary distance between them. This suggests that s2m has been transferred between different RNA virus by non-homologous recombination. A relatively high frequency of recombination is observed within species of coronavirus and picornavirus [18] [19] [20] [21] , both in cell culture and in nature. Recombination has also been demonstrated to occur within astroviruses [3, [22] [23] [24] . RNA recombination enables the exchange of genetic material not only between the same or similar viruses, but also between distinctly different viruses. However, this seems very rare as it depends on coinfection of a single cell by two non-related viruses, and in contrast to recombination within viral species, transfer from one virus family to another cannot involve a homologous recombination mechanism [18, 25, 26] .

Coronavirus is a type of a ribonucleic acid virus with an envelope structure, characterized by rod-like protuberances on the surface and can infect multiple host species, causing a variety of diseases [6] . The COVID-19 pathogen is a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which can infect humans and is significantly clustered with the bat-like severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) sequence isolated in 2015, with a nucleotide similarity of 88%.

It is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe respiratory diseases in humans and can be transmitted from person to person [8] . Therefore, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that the official classification of the novel coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2.

Since both novel picornaviruses harboured two adjacent s2m, called (s2m) 2 , this could suggest a possible increased functional effect of this motif, when present in two copies. (s2m) 2 has previously been observed in one bat astrovirus, BatAstV-LD77, and more recently in one bat coronavirus, ZBCoV [6, 59] (Figure 3) , suggesting a selective advantage for tandem copy of this mobile element in several virus species.

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the coronavirus family, is an enveloped virus with single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA that is about 30 kilobases long. 1 Spike (S) protein, composed of virion projections, is responsible for binding to a receptor and also for the cell entry mechanism of MHV. The cell entry mechanism of MHV is thought to be similar to that of human immunodeficiency virus or other enveloped viruses. 2 Four different splice variants of MHV receptor (MHVR) are known to exist. They have either two or four ectodomains with long or short cytoplasmic tails. 3, 4 Two allelic forms have been reported: one is CEACAM1a, which is expressed in most laboratory mouse strains, and the other is CEACAM1b, which is known thus far to be expressed by only the SJL mouse strain. 5, 6 Although neurovirulent MHV strain JHMV induces encephalomyelitis by infecting a wide spectrum of brain cells including neurons, 7-9 MHVR has not been reported to exist within this wide range of infected cells in the CNS 10 except for microglia. 11 However, in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that the infection of glial progenitors, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, was blocked by pretreatment with the anti-MHVR antibody MAb CC1 or Ab-655, 12 which suggested that MHVR is essential for the initiation of MHV infection in the brain. In mixed neural cell cultures, cl-2 induced syncytia in most of the cells including neurons. 11 On the other hand, solublereceptor-resistant (srr)7, which infects and spreads solely in an MHVR-dependent fashion, 13 infected a limited number of microglia marker-positive cells and infection did not spread, indicating that microglial cells are the initial target for MHV infection and that the wt spreads from initially infected microglia to a variety of cells in an MHVRindependent fashion, which suggested that MHVR is essential for the initiation of MHV infection in the brain. srr7 was isolated as an srr mutant, that is, the mutant virus is not neutralized with the soluble form of MHV receptor proteins. In general, the soluble receptor neutralizes virus infectivity. [14] [15] [16] [17] This neutralization may be due to the ability of the soluble receptor to compete with the membraneanchored receptor for virus binding. 18 Alternatively, the neutralization could be due to receptor-induced conformational changes of the envelope protein, which can no longer bind to the membrane-anchored receptor. 13 Although srr7 surface proteins show binding activity through the S1 region, an N-terminal subunit of the S protein, to the viral receptor, similar to that of wild-type cl-2 protein, srr7 is less virulent than cl-2. The reduced virulence and infectivity of srr7 compared with those of cl-2 could be attributed to the mutation of a single amino acid at position 1114 (Leu to Phe) in the S2 subunit of the viral surface protein, 19 which is not involved in receptor binding activity. This substitution in the S2 subunit could have brought about a structure less vulnerable to conformational changes in the S glycoprotein of srr7 virus compared to that of cl-2, 18 and causes reduced infectivity which occurs only in a receptor-dependent manner, leading to the reduced neurovirulence of srr7 compared to that of the wild-type, cl-2 virus. 13 The conformational changes in the S glycoprotein occur after binding of S1 to the receptor protein to induce fusogenic activities of the membraneanchored fusion subunit, S2. 20 This paper focused on viral spread during the initial phase of infection, especially at 24 h post-inoculation (p.i.), to determine the events that facilitate the dense exposure of the viruses to the cell surfaces of receptor-negative cells including neurons, providing an opportunity for receptorindependent infection in the micro-environments of the brain.

To study RNA editing in vivo, we designed a system that enables to visualize when RNA editing occurs, in which tissues and developmental stage. The system includes RNA editing dependent expression of GFP and mCherry. The main goal of this system is to indicate whether the RNA editing process is tissue specific and/or developmental stage dependent. In addition, I will show how we plan to use the system to perform RNAi and mutagenesis screens to find genes that are involved in regulation of RNA editing. ADARs are mainly localized in the nucleus, however there are some indications that they are also localized and perhaps function in the cytoplasm. In this work I will correlate between ADARs localization and RNA editing function. In addition, we will determine if editing sites in non-coding regions such as 3 0 UTR affect the target protein expression and functionality using immunohistochemistry and genetic methods. This work can lead to better understanding of RNA editing biological role and functionality. moieties bind covalently to target proteins. Such ubiquitin attachments are reversed in the process of deubiquitylation. Due to the reversible nature of ubiquitin modification, the ubiquitin pool of the cells is divided into distinct fractions that include free monoubiquitins as well as covalently linked mono-and polyubiquitin-protein conjugates. These ubiquitin forms reach a dynamic intracellular equilibrium in which the availability of free monoubiquitins appears to be essential for normal cell physiology. Precise measurement of the ubiquitin pool and the ratio of free versus conjugated ubiquitin forms is an important step in the study of the ubiquitylation machinery. Recently, a quick, sensitive and simple immunoassay was developed for simultaneous determination of total, as well as free and conjugated ubiquitins in mice from whole protein extracts by densitometric analysis of Western blots. In the assay, endogenous deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) present in the lysates process all conjugated ubiquitins to monoubiquitins, therefore the total ubiquitin content of cell lysates can be determined in the form of monoubiquitins. The free monoubiquitin fraction in turn is determined from similar lysates supplemented with a DUB inhibitor. Appropriate samples of these lysates are Western blotted together with ubiquitin standards that permit the quantification of the different ubiquitin fractions by densitometric analysis. After adapting this assay to Drosophila, we determined the total, free monoubiquitin and conjugated ubiquitin concentrations in different developmental stages and in various tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. Our data demonstrate the highly dynamic nature of the ubiquitin equilibrium. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR), is a serine/threonine kinase that exerts its own phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of the a subunit of the protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2a. Lysine residues Lys-60, Lys-150, and Lys-440 were previously identified SUMOylation sites in PKR and the triple PKR-SUMO deficient mutant was shown to have reduced PKR activity. There are five SUMO family members, the most studied being SUMO1 and two highly homologous paralogs, SUMO2 and SUMO3. We report that SUMO1 and SUMO3 exert differential effects on endogenous PKR localization and activation. Indeed, SUMO1 expression did not alter PKR localization and resulted alone in PKR and eIF-2a activation with enhanced phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a upon viral infection or dsRNA transfection, whereas, SUMO3 expression induced the transfer of PKR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and annihilated their activation. In addition, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) enhanced PKR conjugation to SUMO1 and SUMO3 but only SUMO3 expression accelerated a caspase-dependent EMCV-induced PKR degradation that occurs in the nucleus. Furthermore, the higher EMCV-induced PKR activation by SUMO1 was correlated with an inhibition of EMCV. Importantly, PKR activation by SUMO1 in the absence of viral infection suggests a novel mechanism for PKR activation and the shift of PKR to the nucleus by SUMO3, may shed a new light on the possible nuclear PKR functions independently of its activation. A search for protein targets of phytaspase, a plant cell deathrelated aspartate-specific protease was undertaken. By testing proteins of plant and plant pathogen origin encompassing a putative phytaspase cleavage site for susceptibility to phytaspasemediated hydrolysis, a set of phytaspase targets was revealed. Due to exclusive specificity of the enzyme, phytaspase was shown to introduce a single or a double break in the target proteins leading to their specific fragmentation/processing. Being synthesized as an inactive precursor protein, phytaspase is constitutively and autocatalytically activated and secreted into the apoplast (intercellular space). However, upon application of programmed cell death-inducing stresses, phytaspase is rapidly relocalized back into the cell. We present evidence that, consistent with this behavior, phytaspase is able to find its targets at various locations: within the secretory pathway, outside the cell, and inside the cell upon the induction of cell death. Furthermore, wounding of plant tissues with concomitant damage of the plasma membrane provides the enzyme with an additional opportunity to get access to intracellular proteins. Accordingly, our data show that phytaspase-mediated protein fragmentation is essential for systemic wound response in plants. We will also discuss a possibility that phytaspase ingested with plant food could find its targets at a quite unexpected place, within the gastrointestinal tract of animals. We show that fragmentation of the phytaspase targets can lead to their inactivation due to detachment of a functionally important domain. However, phytaspase cleavage can cause activation of its targets as well, as exemplified by the phytaspasemediated processing of precursor proteins of plant peptide hormones. Our study thus suggests that in plants like in animals, cell death proteases may possess multiple functions. Kaiso is a member of BTB/POZ zinc finger family, involved in oncogenesis, cell cycle control, apoptosis and WNT signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that Kaiso repression properties depend on posttranslational modification SUMOylation. Various stress treatments including hypoxic, hyperosmotic etc revealed that only hyperosmotic stress influence on Kaiso deSUMOylation. The purpose of this study was determination of Kaiso involvement in hyperosmotic response in vivo, using different knockout models.

Sequence analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the typical genome structure of the coronavirus and belongs to the beta coronavirus genus, which is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans [12] [13] [14] . COVID-19 is the third widespread pandemic virus-related after SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012. SARS-CoV-2 has an 80% similarity to SARS and 50% similarity to MERS at the genome level [12] . SARS-COV-2 can be easily transmitted from person to person through close contact, droplets and aerosols [5, 6, 15, 16] . According to recent reports, the most common symptom of SARS-COV-2 infection is fever, cough, myalgia and fatigue, and the less common symptoms were sputum production, haemoptysis, and diarrhoea [17, 18] . The median incubation period is 5.1 days [19] . Therefore, early diagnosis and isolation are important to control the spread of the epidemic. At present, real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for has been developed and is being used in clinics. In the current emergency, the high false negative rate and the shortage of RT-PCR implies that many COVID-19 patients may not be identified on time. However, most patients with COVID-19 has been diagnosed with pneumonia and characteristic computed tomography (CT) imaging patterns; thus radiological examinations are essential for the early diagnosis and evaluation of the disease. In this review, we focus on the imaging characteristics and changes in patients with COVID-19 to provide some help for frontline clinicians.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a progressive neurological disorder involving an infection with a prion. 33 A prion is thought to be a transmissible, proteinaceous agent. In the United States, CJD occurs in one person per million per year. Prion diseases also can infect sheep (ie, scrapie), cattle (ie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and deer and elk (ie, chronic wasting disease). Transmission has been linked to treatment with • human cadaveric pituitary-derived hormone; • human dura mater grafts; • corneal transplants; and • contaminated neurosurgical instruments, including stereotactic electroencephalogram electrodes. Bloodborne transmission has been linked to two infections in patients with variant CJD. 34 Standard precautions are recommended when caring for patients infected with CJD. 33 Special processes are required when handling tissue in the histology laboratory or when performing an autopsy. It is essential that a very specific method be used for disinfecting surgical equipment and instruments. [35] [36] [37] Processing any CJD-suspect equipment includes soaking the item in sodium hydroxide solution (ie, 1N NaOH) and after removing the item from the solution, steam sterilizing it at 134° C (273° F) for 18 minutes. Alternatively, the item may be soaked in 1N NaOH and, after removal from the solution, steam sterilized at 121° C (250° F) for 30 minutes. Recent studies have indicated that the temperature for steriliza-tion must be exact. If the temperature is above the recommendation, prion growth may occur. [38] [39] [40] [41] SARS. According to the World Health Organization, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak. 42, 43 Of those infected, 774 died. As of February 2003, a total of 418 patients were thought to be infected with SARS in the United States. Of those patients 344 were classified as having "suspected" and 74 as having "probable" SARS cases. 44 All of these people had traveled to other parts of the world where SARS was prevalent. Disease transmission has been documented during endotracheal intubation; noninvasive positive pressure (eg, continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure); and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. [45] [46] [47] [48] The incubation period of SARS CoV is two to 10 days, and symptoms include generalized upper respiratory infections, temperature greater than 38° C (100.4° F), chills, rigors, headache, and rapidly progressing dyspnea. 42, 43, 49, 50 Outbreaks in health care settings have been documented with health care workers becoming ill with the disease after caring for infected patients. 49, 51, 52 AVIAN FLU. Usually, the term avian influenza virus refers to influenza A viruses found most predominantly in birds, but infections with these viruses can and have occurred in humans. 53, 54 Confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza have been reported since 1997. 55 Most cases of avian influenza in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (eg, domesticated chicken, ducks, turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion or excretions from infected birds. [56] [57] [58] [59] The spread of avian influenza virus from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely and has been limited, inefficient, and unsustained. [56] [57] [58] [59] Symptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenzalike symptoms (eg, fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, and severe respiratory diseases (eg, acute respiratory distress) and other severe and lifethreatening complications. The symptoms of avian influenza may depend on which type of avian influenza virus caused the infection. When the virus is documented in humans in the United States, all patients who present to a health care setting with fever and respiratory symptoms should be managed according to CDC recommendations, including respiratory etiquette. Patients and visitors should be questioned regarding their recent travel history. Patients with a history of travel in the previous 10 days to a country with avian influenza activity and who are hospitalized with a severe febrile respiratory illness, 54 or are otherwise being evaluated for avian influenza, should be managed using isolation precautions identical to those recommended for patients with known SARS.

I will use the term envelope to describe the outermost layer that is lipid rich and serves 48 as a barrier to water loss and aids in hydrophobicity. I use the term epicuticle for the next layer. Both of 49 these are rather thin in the Drosophila cuticles studied in this paper. The innermost layer is the 50 procuticle, which is composed of multiple sub-layers of chitin and protein. The chitin fibrils are arranged 51 as parallel arrays and each layer is rotated with respect to its neighboring layers (Bouligand, 1972; 52 Moussian, 2013; Moussian et al., 2006) . The array rotation gives rise to the layered appearance of the 53 procuticle. The procuticle is typically the thickest layer and the arrays of chitin are thought to provide 54 strength and perhaps resilience to failure. In addition to these 3 layers various authors have proposed 55 an additional layer that is juxtaposed between the apical surface of the epidermal cells and the basal 56 region of the procuticle. This fourth layer was given the names such as the assembly zone or adhesion 57 layer (Fristrom et al., 1993; Locke, 1961 ; Moussian et al., 2005; Schmidt, 1956; Sobala and Adler, 2016) . 58

Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City where live animals are routinely sold, it is suggested that this is the likely zoonotic origin of the COVID- 19 . Efforts have been made to search for a reservoir host or intermediate carriers from which the infection may have spread to humans. Initial reports identified two species of snakes that could be a possible reservoir of the COVID-19. However, to date, there has been no consistent evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds [10, 18] . Genomic sequence analysis of COVID-19 showed 88% identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses [19, 20] , indicating that mammals are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans. Several reports have suggested that person-to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID-19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan [13, 21] . Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no evidence that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more susceptible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia (https://www.thelancet.com, DOI:https://doi.org/10. 1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3).

Primary symptoms associated with CoV infection include respiratory, hepatic, enteric and neurological diseases. Previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of CoVs (hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) which can infect the human species. HCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E belongs to alphaCoV genus while rest belongs to betaCoV genus. (Tang et al., 2015) . The betaCoVs appears to be prima-facie genre of CoVs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades. Recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreak spread from China to the intercontinental arena and already infected 0.3 million people globally claiming ~13000 (~4.3%) deaths till 21 st March 2020 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). China and Italy were the epicentres until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future. Genome sequence analysis of SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV confirmed its presence in betaCoVs family and divergence from the other two viruses (Zhu et al., 2020) . The 2019-nCoV is a positivestrand RNA viruses with ~29 Kb genome size, 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs) (Song et al., 2019) . Viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins namely envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M) and 3-5 nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genome starts with short untranslated regions (5' UTR) followed by genes 5′-replicase (rep gene), S, E, M, N and 3' UTR (Song et al., 2019) . Two-third of the genome is represented by the rep gene at 5' end which encodes for non-structural protein (Nsp). Spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre (Du et al., 2009 (Du et al., , 2017 . Viral assembly relies primarily on M and E proteins and RNA synthesis is achieved by action of N protein (Song et al., 2019) .

Middle East respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused at least 1118 reported cases in 24 countries with at least 423 deaths worldwide. All cases are epidemiologically linked to the Arabian Penninsula with most cases reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV has three patterns of presentation: sporadic isolated cases, small clusters of intra-familial transmission and large healthcare-associated infections. The disease presentation varies from asymptomatic/mild cases to severe and fatal cases. The source of the virus has focused on bats and dromedary camels but the exact mode of disease transmission continues to be debated. Current data indicate that the virus spreads from human to human through droplet and contact routes, while performing aerosole-generating procedures predispose to airborne transmission. The best diagnostic tests rely on the identification of MERS-CoV by PCR, and lower respiratory tract samples should be favoured for the diagnosis whenever this is possible in order to avoid false negative results. Recently, the World Health Organization added serology to the list of confirmatory tests. Currently, there is no proven therapy, with supportive treatment being the mainstay of treatment.

The new reality is that national or international governments or public health officials are no longer the first point of contact for the assessment screening of mobile populations. As was clearly demonstrated in Toronto by the recent SARS outbreak, the initial interaction of infected travelers and their contacts was with the primary health care system: their family physician's office and the Emergency Department of a community acute care hospital. Subsequent spread of the SARS-coronavirus from these cases to primary contacts within the health care system was in part due to the lack of recognition and immediate application of infection control procedures, including personal protective gear that would have prevented respiratory droplet transmission of the virus [161] .

COVID-19 is highly transmissible from person to person through respiratory secretions. The virus enters through mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, later affecting lungs. [3] . In the majority of cases, COVID-19 is a mild illness, while some people develop severe disease characterised by respiratory compromise (dyspnoea; respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute; blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%; PaO 2 :FiO 2 < 300; and/or pulmonary infiltrates on >50% of lung fields on radiological imaging) [4] . A minority of patients develop critical disease with septic shock or respiratory and/or multi-organ failure. Fewer than 5% of those affected develop serious or critical illness [5] , which is likely to be an over-estimate since sub-clinical infection rates in the community are unknown. Secondary pneumonic bacterial infection can be an additional problem.

The fevers were contagious, burning, and continuous, all of them pestilential, in most part lethal. The tongue was dry and black. Enormous thirst. Urine of the colors sea-green, vegetal-green, and black, sometimes passing from the greenish color to the pale. Pulse was frequent, fast, small, and weak-sometimes even null. The eyes and the whole body were yellow. This stage was followed by delirium and seizures. Then, hard and painful nodules appeared behind one or both ears along with heartache, chest pain, abdominal pain, tremor, great anxiety, and dysentery. The blood that flowed when cutting a vein had a green color or was very pale, dry, and without serosity. In some cases gangrene and sphacelus invaded their lips, pudendal regions, and other regions of the body with putrefact members. Blood flowed from the ears and in many cases blood truly gushed from the nose. Of those with recurring disease, almost none was saved. Many were saved if the flux of blood through the nose was stopped in time; the rest died. Those attacked by dysentery were usually saved if they complied with the medication. The abscesses behind the ears were not lethal. If somehow their size was reduced either by spontaneous maturation or given exit by perforation with cauteries, the liquid part of the blood flowed or the pus was eliminated; and with it, the cause of the disease was also eliminated, as was the case of those with abundant and pale urine. At autopsy, the liver was greatly enlarged. The heart was black, first draining a yellowish liquid and then black blood. The spleen and lungs were black and semi-putrefacted. The bile was observed in its container. The abdomen dry. The rest of the body, anywhere it was cut, was extremely pale. This epidemic attacked mainly young people and seldom the elder ones. Even if old people were affected they were able to overcome the disease and save their lives. The epidemic started in June 1576 and were not over in December, when I am writing these lines. Of all New Spain, the disease invaded cold lands (highlands) in the perimeter of 400 miles, and had a lesser effect in lowlands. The disease attacked primarily regions populated by Indians here and there, then regions of mixed population of Indians and Spaniards, later the Ethiopians, and now, finally the Spaniards. The weather was dry and quiet, and disturbed by earthquakes, the air was impure, filled with clouds but without resolving into rain… Very few with abdominal distention were saved. In the beginning, the blood was expelled by some without severe disease, then by very few. Vital energy was consumed quickly. 24 Dr Hinojoso made some additional observations, mentioning that the disease lasted 3-4 days from onset to death and that on the second or third day the patient became insane and irritated, eyes were red, thirst was insatiable, and nodules behind the ears and neck were so big that they covered entire neck and half of face. Patient fevers were very high, and autopsies showed extremely large and hard livers and also identified the splenomegaly. 24 The striking aspect of this epidemic was its selective vulnerability of the native population. The selective vulnerability of the indigenous people was not limited to cocoliztli, but also seen with smallpox, chicken pox, measles, and mumps infections. With those diseases, however, an explanation was more forthcoming. The Spanish population had acquired a protective immunity to these diseases due to exposure in Europe at a young age. The native population developed some degree of immunity to those diseases about 20 years later. 24 In 1576, the time of the second epidemic of cocoliztli, many of the Spanish settlers who helped the sick natives were then between 0 and 54 years, but none of them died of disease. Why did the Spaniards who grew up in the new colonies continue to manifest immunity seen in those who had come from Europe? Immunity is not inherited and therefore it is unlikely that, 55 years later, the immune status of Spanish immigrants played any role in epidemic selection. A possible explanation for this selection could lie in the socioeconomic status of that indigenous and colonizing Spanish population as the majority of the native population lived in poverty and were undernourished. 24 Cristobal Godinez, a government official, reporting on the epidemic wrote:

The FIPV is somewhat unique from other viruses, because it is infrequently spread from animal to animal in a horizontal manner, yet it is highly infectious when extracts of affected tissues or fluids are inoculated into na€ ıve cats by a number of routes (see discussion on experimental infection). In this regard, FIPV resembles the infectious acute sarcoma-inducing retroviruses of cats, where the mutant form is found only in tumors, and is not horizontally transmitted in nature, but the parent FeLV is shed in various excretions and secretions and horizontally spread. 30 Therefore, FIPVs are strongly cell and tissue bound and shedding in feces or urine would be possible only under special circumstances, such as if lesions efface the renal collecting ducts or intestinal wall and are shed in urine or feces. The infectivity of urine has been reported at least once in the literature. 31 The genomic structure of all feline coronaviruses is similar. Their genomes are incorporated into a single RNA strand made up of around 29,000 nucleotides.

Abstract We investigated the clinical course of individuals with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who were transferred from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to 12 local hospitals. The conditions and clinical courses of patients with pneumonia were compared with those of patients without pneumonia. Among 70 patients (median age: 67 years) analyzed, the major symptoms were fever (64.3%), cough (54.3%), and general fatigue (24.3%). Forty-three patients (61.4%) had pneumonia. Higher body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate as well as higher of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were associated with the presence of pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Patients were administered neuraminidase inhibitors (20%), lopinavir/ritonavir (32.9%), and ciclesonide inhalation (11.4%). Mechanical ventilation and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on 14 (20%) and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively; two patients died. The median duration of intubation was 12 days. The patients with COVID-19 transferred to local hospitals during the outbreak had severe conditions and needed close monitoring. The severity of COVID-19 depends on the presence of pneumonia. High serum LDH, AST and CRP levels and low serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were found to be predictors of pneumonia. It was challenging for local hospitals to admit and treat these patients during the outbreak of COVID-19. Assessment of severity was crucial to manage a large number of patients.

M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic viral respiratory illness caused by a novel betacoronavirus, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. 1 Since, MERS-CoV cases have been reported across the Arabian Peninsula, with occasional cases exported among travelers to other continents. 2 Dromedary camels are a major reservoir host, in which the virus causes negligible disease. 3 The virus can spread from dromedary camels to humans, through direct or indirect contact, causing significant morbidity and mortality. 4 The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic illness to septic shock and multiorgan failure. 5 As of January 2019, a total of 2298 laboratoryconfirmed human cases of MERS-CoV from 27 countries have been reported, including 811 associated deaths giving a fatality rate of 35.2%. Eighty percent of cases have been reported from countries of the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region. 2 Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been described in several closed clusters of cases, including a small family cluster of mild disease. 5 Two major healthcare-associated outbreaks due to superspreading events led to massive numbers of cases and excessive morbidity and mortality in several countries. 2, 6 Currently, there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. 2, 6 In Oman, the first laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV was reported in June 2013. 7, 8 Up to March 2018, a total of 11 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported sporadically. 5 Ten (91%) cases were males with a mean age of 52±17.7 years (range: 20-75 years). Nine cases (82%) were primary and two cases (18%) were secondary. Patients were predominately from the North Al Batinah governorate (average rate: 1 per 100 000 population) with a fatality rate of 9%. Eight cases (73%) reported domestic camel exposure. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity in eight cases (73%). No secondary cases were reported among healthcare workers. Seroprevalence studies revealed MERS-CoV exposure among all sampled domestic camels across Oman. 9, 10 Between 27 January and 12 February 2019, a total of 13 additional human cases of laboratoryconfirmed MERS-CoV using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were reported in Oman. Eight (61%) and four (39%) cases were residents of North Al Batinah and A'South Sharqiyah governorates, respectively. 11 The first cluster of five females (four from the same family), reported on 27 and 28 January 2019 were residents of North Al Batinah. Their mean age was 42±10.8 years (range: 30-59 years). Three of the five cases were probably secondary cases exposed to the index case who reported a history of direct contact with camels. None of the other cases had contact with camels. However, four cases resided on a farm where camels were kept, and the fifth case had a history of contact with one of the patient's with MERS-CoV at the hospital. Two of the five cases died (40% fatality rate). Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most common comorbidities reported among three of the cases.

There have been many questions regarding testing-availability of validated rapid tests, who should be tested and the process of obtaining specimens. CDC recommends clinicians to work with their local and state health departments to coordinate testing through public health laboratories and, using clinical judgment to determine if a patient who presents for care has symptoms of influenza like illness or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 to make a decision regarding testing. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/priority-testingpatients.pdf ). For patients scheduled for in-patient surgery follow guidance for testing by each Institution/ State. As of March 24 , the CDC guidance for testing priority shows that oral and maxillofacial surgeons (Health care workers and first responders) would be considered as Mode of human-to-human transmission SARS-CoV2 is transmitted from one individual to another predominantly via respiratory droplets through direct or indirect routes. [3] Indirect transmission can occur through contact of inanimate objects (fomite) contaminated by the droplets. [17] Transmission through oral-fecal contamination has also been reported. [18] [19] [20] Droplet transmission occurs when respiratory droplets (>5 um in size) carrying the virus particles /pathogen, spread from the infected host to the susceptible mucosal surface of the recipient. Studies reveal that the respiratory viruses enter via nasal mucosa, conjunctiva and less often through the mouth. Droplets generated while talking, coughing, or sneezing are usually believed to travel up to a distance of one meter (3 feet) but can be farther than 1 meter.

While critics on the right like to refer to the ACA as a federal government takeover of healthcare, at most it was an expansion of health insurance regulation. Even given that limited frame, it was flawed because the shadow of ERISA continues to support regulatory fragmentation as states look to fill in the ACA's gaps. 22 Perhaps, the failure of federalism (both healthcare and public health), aided in large part by the Supreme Court in Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 23 is best illustrated by the patchwork expansion of Medicaid that, once again, emphasized that where Americans live is likely determinative of their access to healthcare. As COVID-19 has spread from the cities to already underserved rural counties, the failure of some states to issue timely stay-at-home orders began to coalesce with the problem of large numbers of uninsured persons. 24 For too many, zip-code healthcare will morph into zip-code infection or mortality. To quote Nicole Huberfeld, "any assumption that states make better health choices is detached from history's lessons." 25 Even in what is beyond doubt a national emergency, the federal government has eschewed its leadership role. Indeed, frequently, the rhetoric of favoring "surgical" interventions is code for pushing the decision down to states or even localities. Worse, the federal government seems to 22

In December 2019, a major outbreak of viral pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus started in Wuhan, China (1) (2) (3) . The disease caused by this novel virus has been named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (4) . The disease has spread widely throughout China, followed by other countries worldwide, and it is now considered a pandemic (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . As the disease spread in the communities has increased, many of the infected persons may not have an obvious history of exposure (10) . The rapid rate of spread confirms the highly infectious nature of the novel coronavirus, which is transmitted from person to person by means of droplets, direct contact, and inhaled air (11) .

C OVID-19 is currently a global pandemic impacting around 212 countries and has already claimed the lives of more than 79,385 individuals worldwide with confirmed cases globally now standing at around 1,356,780. 1 Experts across the world warn that the disease, which originated in the Wuhan district of China in the December of 2019, will only propagate more and the present numbers are likely to inflate further. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 shook the scientific fraternity, and scientists across the world are working tirelessly to understand the virus and its properties in order to design intervention strategies to combat the disease. So far, we have been able to understand that COVID-19 is caused by a virus known as SARS-CoV-2, which is a single-stranded RNA virus (ssRNA) with a genome size of 29903 bp. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same beta-coronavirus clade of the previously reported SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and bears sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. 2 In fact, not only do they bear similarity in sequences, but also the entry point of both the viruses in humans is through the same receptor recognition. The virus SARS-CoV-2 has been speculated to have been transmitted from bats to human considering the fact that evidence of a similar coronavirus, RaTG13, has been reported in bats. 3 SARS-CoV-2 is made up of three structural proteins, namely, the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M), which makes up the viral envelope, and the nucleocapsid containing the RNA genome. It is the spike protein that carries out the frontline action for the virus by performing the initial receptor recognition with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (hACE2). 3 It is this interaction of hACE2 with the viral spike protein that is central to the viral infection.

In the presence of contagious diseases such as SARS, H1N1, and COVID-19, social distancing is an effective nonpharmaceutical approach to limit the disease transmission [8] , [20] , [27] . Social distancing refers to the measures that reduce the disease spread by reducing the frequency and closeness of human physical contacts, such as closing public places (e.g, schools, workplaces), avoiding mass gatherings, and keeping a sufficient distance amongst people [8] , [9] . By reducing the probability that the disease can be transmitted from an infected person to a healthy one, social distancing can significantly reduce the disease's spread and severity. If implemented properly at the early stages of a pandemic, social distancing measures can play a key role in reducing the infection rate and delay the disease's peak, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare systems and lowering death rates [8] , [20] , [27] . Fig. 1 illustrates the effects of social distancing measures on the daily number of cases [11] . As can be observed in Fig. 1(a) , social distancing can reduce the peak number of infected cases [27] to ensure that the number of patients does not exceed the public healthcare capacity. Moreover, social distancing also delays the outbreak peak [27] so that there is more time to implement countermeasures. Furthermore, social distancing can reduce the final number of infected cases [27] , and the earlier social distancing is implemented, the higher the effects will be as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) [11] .

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) were initially identified as causes of acute upper respiratory tract infections in the 1960s using classical tissue culture methods [Kendall et al., 1962; Hamre and Procknow, 1966] . Two of these HCoV strains, designated OC43 and 229E, were detected in individuals with common colds, and occasionally in young children, elderly persons, immunocompromised individuals, and military personnel with lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) [McIntosh et al., 1974; Monto, 1974; Wenzel et al., 1974; Riski and Hovi, 1980; Chany et al., 1982; Sizun et al., 1994 Sizun et al., , 1995 Folz and Elkordy, 1999; Falsey et al., 2002; Gagneur et al., 2002] . Recently, three new HCoV strains have been identified using both molecular and traditional culture methods: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [Drosten et al., 2003] , human coronavirus Netherlands (HCoV-NL63) [Fouchier et al., 2004; , and human coronavirus Hong Kong (CoV-HKU1) [Woo et al., 2005] . SARS-CoV was associated with an outbreak of severe pneumonia that spread from Asia to other parts of the world, but since then has not caused human outbreaks. HCoV-NL63 and CoV-HKU1 have been associated with LRI. Although strains of HCoV have been identified in children, the true burden of severe disease from these viruses is unknown.

One challenge in mobilizing the masses to understand the severity of threat of COVID-19 and the importance of social distancing is the invisibility of the disease. Our eyes cannot literally see how the coronavirus spreads from person to person. In the United States, at the time of writing this essay, many of us can also not yet see the tragic effect of the disease on our community members or loved ones, with the exception of the major epicenters of the outbreak such as Washington and New York. At this point, the pandemic remains shrouded in invisibility to most American eyes, lest we find the courage to watch news clips of the traumatic hospital scenarios in China and Italy. Similar to a psychological understanding of climate change apathy, it is difficult to hold tangible concern for a future calamity that appears intangible to us in present day. Thus, health care professionals' pleas for American citizens to take seriously the adoption of health precautions and social distancing practices can fall on apathetic ears and eyes. What can help people reverse apathy and confront reality is the restoration of vision-of literally seeing the coronavirus and its impact on us and our loved ones: "vision is . . . one of the means by which we interact with and relate to the world, and by increasing our visual awareness, we extend and intensify our relationship to life" (McNiff, 1981, p. 155) .

Nepal is among one of the nine countries that reported just five cases of COVID-19 as of March 28, 2020. Most COVID-19 cases are handled and treated at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and the SARS-CoV-2 testing is being done at the Nepal Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu. The first positive case of COVID-19 in Nepal was reported on January 13, 2020, in a 32-year-old Nepalese student based at Wuhan University of Technology, with no known comorbidities who had returned to Nepal [12] . The patient presented at a hospital in Kathmandu, complaining of cough. He had developed symptoms six days before his travel to Nepal. Throat swabs taken from the patient were found to be positive for COVID-19 using real-time quantification assays performed at the WHO laboratory in Hong Kong. Fortunately, the patient recovered 13 days post-exposure. The second case was confirmed on 23rd March 2020. This was a 19-year old female student who returned to Nepal from France via Qatar on March 17. The third case of Coronavirus was tested positive on 25rd march 2020 who is a 32-year-old male returned from United Arab Emirates on March 19. He stayed at a hotel in Kathmandu and later confirmed for COVID-19 . On March 27, 2020, the fourth case was test positive which is among the first confirmed case outside the Kathmandu valley. This patients is a 37-year-old male returned recently from the Middle East. The fifth case is a 19-year-old female who travelled to Kathmandu from Belgium via Qatar and was confirmed on March 28, 2020. This patient had travelled with the patient who was diagnosed on March 23 (in the same flight from Doha to Kathmandu). Considering the risk of COVID-19 transmission, the government of Nepal has initiated various preventive measures. Several districts including Kathmandu are in lockdown where people are asked stay at home except for emergency reasons. Dedicated health-desks have been set-up at the international airport and on the border checkpoints with India and china. All foreign nationals who enter Nepal must remain in self-quarantine for 14 days and all international flights have been suspended. The government of Nepal has stopped all promotional campaigns such as 'Visit Nepal 2020';'Sagarmatha Sambad 2020' and others international events.

With the production of SPF animals, the risk of transmission of diseases would be limited to some pathogens capable of producing latent infections in the source animal and caused by vertically transmitted viruses that cannot be prevented in the source animal by early weaning and/or caesarean birth. All species have viruses that persist within the host cells in a latent state. While the best known are the herpes viruses and retroviruses, these also include the hepatitis viruses, adenoviruses, rabies and pseudorabies viruses, reoviruses, and papovaviruses among others. It is still not known whether nonhuman latent viruses represent an infection and disease risk for humans. In vitro, it has been possible to infect human neurons with the porcine pseudorabies virus and to transmit various viruses between species in experimental models. Nevertheless, it is hard to believe that in the case of a species such as the pig, with which humans have been in contact for many thousands of years, there are many infections with capacity of being transferred from person to person that have not yet manifested themselves. On the other hand, the infection caused by Nipah virus in pig slaughterhouse workers in Asia, after contact with infected animals, and the recent epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by a coronavirus, transmitted through the consumption of exotic animals in China, are good examples of the ability these zoonoses to spread.

UNLABELLED ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational protein modification in which ADP-ribose is transferred from NAD(+) to specific acceptors to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. The macro domain is an ancient and highly evolutionarily conserved protein domain widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life, including viruses. The human TARG1/C6orf130, MacroD1, and MacroD2 proteins can reverse ADP-ribosylation by acting on ADP-ribosylated substrates through the hydrolytic activity of their macro domains. Here, we report that the macro domain from hepatitis E virus (HEV) serves as an ADP-ribose-protein hydrolase for mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chain removal (de-MARylation and de-PARylation, respectively) from mono- and poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins, respectively. The presence of the HEV helicase in cis dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to poly(ADP-ribose) and stimulates the de-PARylation activity. Abrogation of the latter dramatically decreases replication of an HEV subgenomic replicon. The de-MARylation activity is present in all three pathogenic positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus families which carry a macro domain: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E), Togaviridae (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), and Hepeviridae (HEV), indicating that it might be a significant tropism and/or pathogenic determinant. IMPORTANCE Protein ADP-ribosylation is a covalent posttranslational modification regulating cellular protein activities in a dynamic fashion to modulate and coordinate a variety of cellular processes. Three viral families, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, possess macro domains embedded in their polyproteins. Here, we show that viral macro domains reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation, potentially cutting the signal of a viral infection in the cell. Various poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases which are notorious guardians of cellular integrity are demodified by macro domains from members of these virus families. In the case of hepatitis E virus, the adjacent viral helicase domain dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to PAR and simulates the demodification activity.

Nothing is easy about preparing for a biological disaster, especially on a large scale. The task is further complicated by the added dimension that the disaster you may be preparing for will be due to an intentional, covert act that is strategically used in the areas where you are weakest. Such is the insidious nature of bioterrorism and biowarfare. Regardless, we may all find ourselves rather "flat-footed" if and when that moment comes, especially if we are unable to recognize early on that the problem exists. This is all the more dangerous if the agent that emerges is highly transmissible from person to person, the incubation period short, and the case-fatality rate high. A few examples that come to mind are smallpox, pneumonic plague, and pandemic influenza. Our hope is that BioWatch provides us with early detection, which of course depends on where the sensors are placed and what they monitor. Probably one of the best investments we have made along these lines is the establishment of the LRN. Having the ability to quickly and definitively identify the problem is a mainstay of the LRN's charter. This extensive and highly capable network stands to recognize the threat, which will enable us to focus response efforts and get onto the business of recovery.

The natural history of COVID‐19 caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection, mainly in children, to multi‐organ failure, eventually fatal, mainly in the eldest. We propose here the first model, explaining how the outcome of first, crucial 10‐15 days after infection, hangs on the balance between the cumulative dose of viral exposure and the efficacy of the local innate immune response (natural IgA and IgM antibodies, Mannose Binding Lectin ). If SARS‐CoV‐2 runs the blockade of this innate immunity and spreads from the upper airways to the alveoli in the early phases of the infections, it can replicate with no local resistance, causing pneumonia and releasing high amounts of antigens. The delayed and strong adaptive immune response (high affinity IgM and IgG antibodies) that follows, causes severe inflammation and triggers mediator cascades (complement, coagulation, and cytokine storm) leading to complications often requiring intensive therapy and being, in some patients, fatal. Low‐moderate physical activity can still be recommended. However, extreme physical activity and hyperventilation during the incubation days and early stages of COVID‐19, facilitates early direct penetration of high numbers of virus particles in the lower airways and the alveoli, without impacting on the airway’s mucosae covered by neutralizing antibodies. This allows the virus bypassing the efficient immune barrier of the upper airways mucosa in already infected, young and otherwise healthy athletes. In conclusion, whether the virus or the adaptative immune response reach the lungs first, is a crucial factor deciding the fate of the patient. This “quantitative and time‐sequence dependent” model has several implications for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID‐19 at all ages.

An outbreak of novel coronavirus-related pneumonia COVID-19, that was identified in December 2019, has expanded rapidly, with cases now confirmed in more than 211 countries or areas. This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19. A recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the replication and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov) in vitro. In the United States, one case of COVID-19 was successfully treated with compassionate use of remdesivir in January of 2020. In addition, a clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells. Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection. Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

It has been shown that the bat virus with 96% nucleotide sequence similarity to human SARS-CoV can use human ACE2 as a receptor. This represents the same state of entry into the cell as human SARS-CoV. For example, bat SL-CoV-WIV1 can grow on human epithelial cells and Vero E6 cells, which is neutralized by human SARS-CoV convalescent sera (Ge et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2016) .

This antibiotic is Chloroquine has recently been shown to be an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and the hydroxylated form has been suggested as a potential treatment for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cases of this disease were first reported from Saudi Arabia by ProMED and formally published soon after (Bermingham et al. 2012) . MERS affects the respiratory system and most MERS patients develop severe acute respiratory illness with fever, cough and shortness of breath. The case-fatality rate of MERS is about 45%. Through retrospective investigations, health officials later showed that the first known cases of MERS occurred in Jordan in 2012. Thus far, all cases of MERS have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. This virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. As of 23 January 2015, there have been 956 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS CoV infection, including 351 deaths, a large proportion of whom had pre-existing co-morbidities. Because of its similarity to the SARS CoV, it had been anticipated that bats were somehow involved in transmission of the MERS CoV and Memish et al. (2013) detected a partial RNA sequence of a betacoronavirus with 100% identity to virus from the human index casepatient. This nucleotide sequence was obtained from a faecal pellet from an Egyptian tomb bat [Taphozous perforatus (Emballonuridae) (Memish et al. 2013) ] in Saudi Arabia, and a close relative of this virus was detected in a Zulu serotine bat [Neoromicia cf. zuluensis (Vespertilionidae)] by Ithete et al. (2013) in South Africa. However, recent studies have suggested that one-humped camels [Camelus dromedarius (Artiodactyla, Camelidae)] may be a primary source of this virus in nature (Raj et al. 2014 ) and experimental infections of camels with MERS CoV seem to support this view (Adney et al. 2014) . MERS CoV continues to cause disease in the Arabian Peninsula, but is not expected to cause a pandemic.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the name of the virus that led to the COVID-19 pandemic disease. The virus is transmitted from human to human primarily through virusladen fluid particles ejected from the mouth of infected people. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a diameter of 70-90 nm (Kim et al. 2020) and it is carried by droplets and aerosol (van Doremalen et al. 2020; Y. Liu et al. 2020) . Larger droplets (≤100 !m) reach the ground within 1 s without significant evaporation (Wells 1934) , while the smaller the droplet the slower it falls and the faster it evaporates (W. F. Wells 1934; William Firth Wells 1955; Xiaojian Xie et al. 2009; Bourouiba, Dehandschoewercker, and Bush 2014; Vejerano and Marr 2018) . The emitted fluid particles are often categorised as larger droplets from 5 !m to 1 mm in diameter that have a ballistic trajectory, and aerosol that remain airborne. Droplets smaller than 5 !m and desiccated droplet nuclei are known as aerosol, which can remain airborne for several hours (Nicas, Nazaroff, and Hubbard 2005; Tellier 2006 ; van Doremalen et al. 2020) .

These newly described characteristics of deltaviruses raise numerous questions regarding the range of possible helper viruses, and factors contributing to deltavirusglycoprotein interactions and subsequent infectious particle formation. Further studies will need to address which viruses can act as deltavirus helpers. It is tempting to speculate that deltaviruses would be opportunistic microbes, the exit (or infectious particle formation) of which would rely on persistent, latent, or recurring infections by enveloped viruses. Such infections could include arenaviruses and hantaviruses, both of which cause persistent infection in rodents (52, 53) . In humans, examples of persistent viral infections could include HBV, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, the first two of which have already been demonstrated to induce the formation of infectious HDV particles (28) . Additionally, recurring infections such as those caused by ortho-, paramyxo-, or coronaviruses or latent infections caused by, e.g., herpesviruses, could contribute to the spread of deltaviruses. Thus, it seems fair to speculate that HDV could present merely the tip of an iceberg in terms of human deltavirus infections. This theory would be supported by the detection of HDAg in the absence of HBV from the salivary glands of Sjögren's syndrome patients (54) . As the number and variety of deltaviruses are greater than earlier assumed, it would be worth to explore whether deltaviruses are underlying or exacerbating agents in both animal and human diseases. It is tempting to speculate that a common ancestor of deltaviruses could be found among viroids of higher plants, as they show the highest similarities with deltaviruses (4). Since a deltavirus has already been identified in termites (8) , one could hypothesize that the deltavirus ancestor was transmitted to Animalia from plants. Indeed, Van Bogaert and colleagues showed the presence of viroids in aphids feeding on infected plants (55) , which could support the above hypothesis. However, the questions regarding the origin of deltaviruses will need to be addressed by further studies.

For this study, we were particularly interested in the relationship between the amount of people traveling from Wuhan/Hubei to other provinces and the number of new confirmed cases in those provinces. Given the original data from Baidu is city-level, we first extracted all the outbound data from Wuhan (which is the capital of Hubei and the first city with confirmed COVID-19 cases) and mapped all the cities belonging to the same province to get province-level outbound mobility from Wuhan. We obtained a 31x31 matrix, where each row is a province in China, and each column is one day in January, each element shows the percentage of people traveling out of Wuhan to the other provinces, among all people traveling from Wuhan on that day.

The outbreak of pneumonia that originated in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei in December, 2019 was attributed to a new strain of coronavirus: "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2)", initially called "2019-nCoV" [1, 2] . On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)". This infection spread quickly from Wuhan to various regions in China, and then to other parts of the world including Japan, Europe, and the United States. On March 11, the WHO officially designated this event a pandemic. At the time of writing on April 29, 2020, a PubMed search of the term "COVID-19" found 7787 articles concerning COVID-19. Given that the first article was published in January this year, the number of submitted papers has been increasing exponentially. The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing event across the globe, with the number of confirmed cases increasing rapidly in Japan owing to widespread infection. Amid these circumstances, new reports update the epidemiological information as well as basic/clinical findings on a daily basis. In this manuscript, we report on the documented clinical/surgical findings of COVID-19 as well as the infection status in Japan and other countries.

Sialic acids, terminal sugars of glycoproteins and glycolipids, play important roles in development, cellular recognition processes and host–pathogen interactions. A common modification of sialic acids is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition, ganglioside biology, and the survival and drug resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. Despite many functional implications, the molecular basis of 9-O-acetylation has remained elusive thus far. Following cellular approaches, including selective gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we here show that CASD1—a previously identified human candidate gene—is essential for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation. In vitro assays with the purified N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 demonstrate transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A to CMP-activated sialic acid and formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Our study provides direct evidence that CASD1 is a sialate O-acetyltransferase and serves as key enzyme in the biosynthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans.

Recommendations and guidance on case definitions, infection control (including use of personal protective equipment), case investigation, and specimen collection and shipment for testing are available at the CDC coronavirus Web site. Additional information and potentially frequent updates will be posted on that site. State and local health illnesses are almost always caused by known respiratory pathogens, emergency physicians should recognize the risk of novel pathogens and be familiar with current recommendations for evaluating patients who may be infected with emerging pathogens from specific geographic areas. This report of a new coronavirus (now referred to as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV) identified in patients in the United Kingdom after travel to the Arabian Peninsula illustrates some important points about identifying infections with novel pathogens and implementing infection control procedures when specific transmission risk may be unknown. The 3 confirmed cases demonstrate that the virus has the capability of human-to-human transmission and coinfection with another pathogen (influenza A). 1 Subsequent clusters of disease confirm that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person, including from patients to health care workers. Although MERS-CoV has a different genetic sequence than the virus that caused SARS, the implications for emergency medicine are similar. 2 Health care providers, hospital administrators, and global health organizations learned many important lessons during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The subsequent improvement in infection control measures is especially important for the ED in the event of infectious outbreaks with new pathogens. Transmission in the health care setting to a large number of health care workers and other patients was a notable feature of the SARS coronavirus. The greatest risk of transmission was to individuals who had close contact with infected subjects and who were not properly trained in the use of protective equipment. 3 Exposure of health care providers to procedures that aerosolized droplets such as nebulizers, suctioning, and intubation was another source of virus transmission. 4 N95 respirators may offer protection to individuals involved in highrisk procedures. 5 CDC recommendations for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette evolved during the SARS outbreak. These concepts have since been incorporated into CDC planning documents for SARS and pandemic influenza. Although basic precautions such as hand washing are intended for health care workers associated with direct patient contact, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette applies to everyone in the hospital setting: providers, patients, and visitors. 6 This concept was developed in response to observations that visitors and patients without diagnoses were contributing to hospital transmission. 3 Recommendations included posted signs in different languages about containment of respiratory secretions, convenient hand sanitizers and tissue receptacles, and sitting at least 3 feet apart if coughing. Screening patients with respiratory symptoms for recent travel, placing a mask, and isolation from others in the waiting room/ ED are important for early detection and prevention. 7 For pathogens that emerge in specified geographic areas, risk assessment is based on where the organism is currently circulating, ie, within the local community, limited geographic areas, or not actively circulating anywhere in the world. 8 If

In eight female pigs of 40 kgs intubated, sedated, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated, ARDS was induced by repeated saline lavage until PaO2/FIO2 < 100 mmHg under FIO2 1 and PEEP 5cmH2O. Pes was measured by Nutrivent catheter. Ppl was measured by custom-made pouch sensors inserted surgically into the right anterior and posterior sixth intercostal space. Ppl sensors were filled with air. After ARDS induction animals were randomly assigned to SP or PP. In each position, a recruitment manoeuver was performed and PEEP decreased from 20 to 5 cmH2O by steps of 5cmH2O lasting 10 min each, then the animals were crossed over into the alternate position where the same procedure was done. At the end of each step nonstressed volume and correct position (Baydur maneuver) were determined for Pes and Ppl sensors, then a 3-s end-expiratory occlusion was performed and Pes and Ppl recorded. Linear mixed model was used to compare the value of Pes and Ppl at each PEEP and position. Results: Box-and-whisker plots of Pes and Ppl in SP and PP are shown in Fig. 1 . There is marked dorsal-to-ventral gradient in Ppl at each PEEP in SP, which is reverted in PP at PEEP 10 and 15 only. There was no interaction between pressures and PEEP or position. With increasing PEEP Pes increased significantly from PEEP 5 in SP and PP. PEEPt,PplVentral was significantly lower than PEEPt,es in SP but not in PP. (Medtronic) , Carescape 860 (GE)) were set in pressure support 0 cmH2O, PEEP 4 cmH2O, FIO2 21% and equipped with the same double limb ventilator circuit (Intersurgical) without any humidification device. ASL 5000 bench model was set with 3 inspiratory/expiratory resistance (R) and compliance (C) combinations: R13/12-C54, R12/14-C39 and R22/18-C59 mimicking normal, ARDS and COPD conditions, respectively (1) . Inspiratory effort generated by ASL 5000 consisted of 30 consecutive breaths obtained from the esophageal pressure in a real patient at the time of a spontaneous breathing trial. For each ICU ventilator and RC combination, two steps were performed: in the first, ATC was not activated and ventilator attached to ASL 5000 without ETT (ATC-ETT-); in the second, ATC was set on at 100% compensation for an ETT 8 mm ID and such an ETT (Shiley Hi contour, Covidien) joined ICU ventilator to ASL 5000 (ATC+ ETT+). The null hypothesis is that VTATC+ ETT+ minus VTATC-ETT-is 0. Primary end point was the breath by breath paired difference betwen ATC+ ETT+ and ATC-ETT-. It was tested to zero for each ventilator in each RC condition. Results: Median VT was 213 ml. Table 1 displays mean (± SD) difference in VT (ml) between ATC+ ETT+ and ATC-ETT-: a negative value means that ATC under delivers and a positive value that ATC over delivers VT for a given patient's inspiratory effort and RC. In four ventilators (C6, S1, Elisa 800 and 980) ATC almost systematically under delivered VT. In several instances under compensation was greater than 10% median VT. By contrast ATC performed better with the other three ventilators (Evita XL, V500 and Carescape 860). Conclusion: ATC tended to under deliver VT. Furthermore, there were marked differences between ICU ventilators the clinician should be aware of when using the ATC option. Compliance with ethics regulations: NA. Rationale: During the last decades, identification of factors associated with ventilation-induced lung injury has led to improved survival in patients with ARDS. The mechanical power of ventilation is the total energy transmitted from the ventilator to the respiratory system per unit of time and comprises three different components: elastic related to PEEP, elastic related to tidal volume and resistive. This integrative variable has been recently proposed as an useful predictor of ventilationinduced lung injury and death among ventilated patients. Our goal was to determine the respective impact of the total mechanical power and its three components on the outcome of patients with ARDS. Patients and methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of a randomized, controlled study of patients with ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150. Themechanical power at inclusion and averaged on the first 2 days after inclusion (total and its three different components) was computed according to the following equation: PowerRS (J/ min) = 0.098 Respiratory Rate Tidal Volume [PEEP (1) + ½ Driving Pressure (2) + (Peak Pressure-Plateau Pressure) (3)], where the (1), (2) and (3) parts correspond respectively to the elastic related to PEEP, elastic related to tidal volume and resistive components. The association between each of these four types of mechanical power evaluated during the first 2 days after inclusion and mortality at D90 was assessed one after the other through multiple logistic regression, allowing control for potential confounding variables at inclusion (age, IGS score without age, group of randomization, PaO2/FiO2, arterial pH). Results: Data from 339 patients were analyzed, among which 115 (33.9%) died before D90. There was no difference concerning the mechanical power at inclusion between survivors and non survivors (either total or its three components). Among the four different types of mechanical power tested during the first 2 days after inclusion, the elastic component related to tidal volume was the only one that was independently associated with mortality at D90 (OR 1.030; 95% CI 1.003-1.058; p = 0.03) (Figure) . Conclusion: Our study shows that only the elastic component of the mechanical power related to tidal volume independently predicted mortality at D90 among patients with ARDS, whereas the total mechanical power, its elastic component related to PEEP and its resistive component did not. Further studies are needed to better define how the mechanical power of ventilation could be useful to synthetize the risk of ventilation-induced lung injury. Compliance with ethics regulations: Yes.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged as an infectious agent in 2003, causing severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease in humans. The virus had spread rapidly from Southern China to Hong Kong and to the rest of the world, resulting in the SARS epidemic which lasted for 4 months and was eventually put to an end through the implementation of intensive public health measures. The epidemic caused a total of more than 8000 infections with a fatality rate of 10% and a considerable amount of social hardship and economic loss. 1 Ever since the emergence of SARS, much effort has been made to understand the origin and the emergence of SARS-CoV. Cross-species jumping events have led to the emergence of SARS-CoV in humans. Small animals such as palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procynonoides) sold in live-animal wet markets in Guangdong Province of Southern China were the immediate sources of the virus transmitted to humans during the 2003 SARS outbreak. 2 Nonetheless, numerous observations suggest that palm civets and other small animals were merely conduits for SARS-CoV transmission to humans rather than the natural wild-life reservoir harboring the virus. Firstly, viral RNA detection and anti-SARS sera were only detected in civets from marketplace but not in farmed or wildlife civets, indicating that palm civets are not widely infected by SARS-CoV. 3 In addition, sequence comparison of various civet SARS-CoV isolates revealed high non-synonymous/synonymous nucleotide substitution ratio, indicating ongoing mutation and evolving process of the virus in civets, further suggesting that palm civets are unlikely the natural reservoir of the virus. 4 High prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies was detected in serological surveys involving people not infected with SARS-CoV but worked in retail business of palm civets, indicating that cross-transmissions of a precursor SARS-CoV probably occurred before the actual SARS epidemic. 2 In the past, the inability to culture and isolate some viruses greatly hindered the study of these viruses and the understanding of viral ecology and diversity. The development of metagenomic sequencing technology has enabled the discovery of new viral species in a culture-independent and sequence-independent manner, contributing significantly to the field of viral metagenomics. 5 With the advancements made to the technology, it is now able to carry out high throughput sequencing of large viral genomes with only miniscule amount of viral DNA samples. 6 This greatly aided in the discovery of many coronaviruses, which are the largest RNA viruses known so far, particularly in bats. Since the SARS epidemic, a huge diversity of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), which are coronaviruses of high sequence homology to human SARS-CoV epidemic strains, have been discovered from bats in many countries across the world, including South East Asian, European and African countries (for a review see ref. 7 ). However, most of these bat SL-CoVs failed to grow in cell culture, presenting barriers to understand viral replication and pathogenesis. Improvements in the reverse genetic systems for coronavirus have allowed these methods to be widely used in the construction of live SARS-CoV. 8 Through the use of these systems, the enormous amount of information derived from metagenomics sequencing could be utilized to create synthetic coronavirus clones, allowing studies of these viruses to be performed and to identify those which have potential to emerge and cause diseases in humans. Herein, we summarized the findings in some recent publications to highlight the importance of these technological advances in the study of SL-CoVs which have the potential to cause future pandemics.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in China, causing outbreaks of pneumonia [1] . The virus was subsequently identified as a betacoronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which includes asymptomatic upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Among the first European cases of COVID-19, six were associated with a cluster of transmissions in the French Alps in late January 2020 [2] . The index case of this cluster travelled from Singapore to France and went back to the United Kingdom (UK) where he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on February 6th.

Germs associated with cold and flu may be spread from person to person through droplet spread such as is associated with respiratory droplets of coughs and sneezes (CDC 2000) . Germs can also be spread when a person touches droplets on the surface of desks, doorknobs, cafeteria tables, etc. and then touches her own eyes, mouth, or nose before washing her hands. According to the CDC, addressing the spread of germs in schools is essential to the health of the students. Germs have a considerable adverse effect on U.S. education (CDC 2000) . Flu, for example, is known to cause the highest rate of absenteeism with nearly 22 million school days being lost each year to the common cold alone. To stop the spread of germs, the CDC advises people to cover their mouths and noses during coughing or sneezing and to clean their hands after coughing, sneezing or doing anything that is capable of spreading germs.

The history of humanity has been marked by the impact of many fearsome epidemics of infectious disease. At the start of the 21 st century, the international community experienced a similarly frightening public health emergency, on a global scale, with the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS was an unusual corona virus-based pneumonia that spread rapidly [1] . The SARS epidemic demonstrated that one effect of globalization has been to make it possible for an infectious disease to travel from one continent to another in a matter of hours, and highlighted the importance of international coordination of efforts to respond to novel outbreaks of infectious disease. It was first detected in November 2002 in China's Guangdong province, and eventually affected more than 25 countries. China was one of the most severely affected countries, and Beijing among the world's most heavily affected cities, according to the World Health Organization's summary report [2, 3] .

The evolving story of the COVID-19 outbreak has advanced over a remarkably short time frame (Fig 1) . On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin, all linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. This market harboured a variety of live and deceased exotic wildlife, including live bamboo rats, palm civets, badgers, and wolf cubs. It is notable that a quarter of the initially reported 27 pneumonia cases presented with severe disease. 45 Within days, the cause of the pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 2 On January 19, 2020 the WHO issued a warning that the virus may have the ability to spread from human to human. 3 Wuhan is a major transportation hub within China with a population of 11 million. On a typical day, approximately 3500 people take flights to other countries from Wuhan, and the number increases with holidays and the Chinese Lunar New Year. Within 1 month, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to more than 9000, surpassing the number of SARS and MERS cases reported to date. Similarly, global fears escalated as cases spread to other countries. Extensive control measures were put into place, starting with massive decontamination efforts and, ultimately, closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, banning the trade of wildlife and poultry in wet markets, contact tracing of cases, exit screening at airports, lockdown and quarantine measures that progressed to include adjacent cities (an estimated 50e60 million people affected), school closures, extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, prohibition of mass gatherings, and building of two new hospitals (1000 and 1600 beds) to care for infected individuals. Other nations instituted airport screening, travel bans, and evacuating citizens from Hubei Province and quarantining them through the incubation period. 6 Despite these measures, the case counts continued to increase in the outbreak epicenter, and countries with imported cases reported clusters of human-to-human transmission. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared a PHEIC, calling for intensified international collaborative efforts to halt the outbreak. 3 Although Chinese authorities have heavily restricted movement from Wuhan, this austere measure came at the same time as the Spring Festival, a time when the number of outbound travellers from Wuhan is estimated to be more than 15 million.

The patient was a 35-year-old woman without a significant medical history. On January 21, 2020, she travelled to Japan from Wuhan, China. She was healthy until January 30 when she developed fever with mild diarrhoea. On January 31, at the primary care clinic, the rapid influenza antigen test was negative. Chest X-ray revealed signs of pneumonia in the left lower lung and she was transferred to the Japanese Red Cross Narita Hospital. She denied having sore throat, rhinorrhea, chills and cough. She had not visited Huanan market and was not exposed to any wild or dead animals. On admission, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 106/66 mmHg, heart rate 93 beats/min, body temperature 37.9 C, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min and oxygen saturation on room air 97%. Her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results did not reveal leukocytosis, leukocytopenia or elevated liver function enzymes. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed slight ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung lobe ( Figure 1 ). She was admitted to an isolation room with negative pressure. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were administered after obtaining a throat swab. The PCR test on the throat swab for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. Her fever persisted but she had no respiratory symptoms such as cough. On hospital day 5, induced sputum and a second throat swab were obtained. The PCR test on induced sputum was positive but the throat swab was still negative. Her condition was stable and fever and diarrhoea improved on hospital day 6. She recovered fully and was discharged on hospital day 12 after sputum and throat swab samples tested negative by PCR. During her clinical course, she never had a PCR-positive throat swab ( Figure 2 ). All PCR tests were performed at the reference laboratory by real-time RT-PCR assays following a previously described method [3] .

From our estimates, wildlife consumption could represent a significant portion of people's protein intake as the median yearly quantity of bushmeat purchase was comparable to average yearly per capita meat consumption (FAOSTAT, 2018) . In absence of information on how the bushmeat is shared within households, it is difficult to fully estimate the proportion of protein needs covered by bushmeat. Nevertheless, in urban settings such as where these surveys were conducted, there is no reason from a nutritional and economic standpoint for consuming wildlife rather than readily available (and cheaper) domestic meat. However, the bushmeat traded in urban wildlife markets diverts precious protein resources from more remote rural communities that truly rely on this nutritional input. The absence of association between the consumption patterns and the socio-economic indicators suggest that wildlife consumption in these urban centers was indeed tied to preference and not necessity, which was confirmed by "taste preference" being the primary reported motivation for wildlife consumption. On a conservation and public health perspective, this may be problematic, as taste preference is likely to be a difficult aspect to address and change through communication or education campaigns, and change may only be achieved through law enforcement. Reducing wildlife consumption in urban centers is crucial to reducing the demand and offtake of wildlife from natural areas, and keeping wildlife offtake at sustainable levels so that communities which most depend on it can continue hunting for subsistence. It should be noted that the disruption of this illegal trade may have consequences on the livelihood of the rural community, as the income derived from the sale of bushmeat can sometimes contribute significantly to livelihood and well-being of rural households (Schulte-Herbrüggen et al., 2013) . However, a previous study in Lao PDR found that the extra income earned by remote rural communities members from selling bushmeat was most often used to purchase Fig. 4 . Disease ranked by frequency of citation by bushmeat consumers in Laos when asked A) generally about disease transmitted from wildlife to humans, and B) specifically about disease transmitted from wildlife in the market they were visiting. non-nutritive goods such as alcohol, sweets, and monosodium glutamate (MSG, a widely used food additive in Southeast Asia) (Johnson et al., 2012) .

Presently COVID-19 seems to spread from person to person by the same mechanism as other common cold or influenza viruses-ie, face to face contact with a sneeze or cough, or from contact with secretions of people who are infected. The role of faecal-oral transmission is yet to be determined in COVID-19 but was found to occur during the SARS outbreak. 10 The lock-down of Wuhan City seems to have slowed international spread of COVID-19; however, the effect is expected to be short-lived (WHO modelling group). Efforts are currently underway in China, in the 24 countries to which infected persons have travelled, and in public conveyances, such as cruise ships, to interrupt transmission of all existing and potential chains of transmission, with elimination of COVID-19 in human populations as the final goal. This WHOrecommended strategy is regularly assessed each week by STAG-IH on the basis of daily risk assessments by WHO as information becomes available from outbreak sites.

Coronaviruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV are typically found in bats (Li et al. 2005) . There is evidence that SARS-CoV originated in bats in China and reached humans most probably after jumping to an intermediate host, the civet (Paguma larvata) (reviewed by Wang and Eaton 2007) . Similarly, MERS-CoV is endemic in dromedary camels in the Middle East, from which it can be transmitted to humans, but it may also have originated in bats (Cui et al. 2019) . The MERS epidemic is ongoing, and as of December 2019, 2468 cases have been reported (Baharoon and Memish 2019) and the mortality rate has been as high as 42% (Mohd et al. 2016) . At the other end of the virulence spectrum are coronavirus species that cause common colds in humans with relatively mild symptoms (reviewed by Su et al. 2016) .

Since mutant proteins formed a stable covalent bond with GMP, we investigated whether the bound GMP could be transferred from VP4 to the 5 0 end of the ssRNAs to form the 'cap' structure i.e., the guanylyltransferase activity. All mutant recombinant proteins and WT VP4 were therefore incubated with unlabelled and uncapped T7 generated RNAs of one of the BTV segments (S5) in the presence of a 32 P-GTP for 2 h. The purified ssRNAs were analyzed by a denatured gel and a 32 P-labelled RNAs were detected. All recombinant mutant proteins as well as control WT protein were able to generate a 32 P radio-labelled ssRNAs confirming that the GMP moiety (a 32 P-GMP) was transferred to the 5 0 ppG-RNA of the BTV ssRNA (Fig. 2B) . N311A mutant protein catalyzed the capping of the ssRNA as efficiently as WT VP4. While mutations of the residues (Y334A, R367A and NYR) that are exposed at the VP4 surface and were predicted to interact with cap0, and D265 mutants were less efficient at transferring the GMP to the ssRNA (Fig. 2B) . The reduction in guanylyltransferase activity (5-20%) observed for these mutant proteins was the same as that observed for the GMP binding activity. Reaction without VP4 did not generate any labelled ssRNAs (Fig. 2B) . These results indicate that the function of the GTase domain was not significantly affected by the introduction of these mutations and structural integrity was maintained.

Both the Foundation for Vaccine Research, of which I am a member, and the World Health Organization have created lists of known pathogens that cause what are usually called emerging or neglected diseases. The list includes haemorrhagic fever viruses other than Ebola, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus that spread from Saudi Arabia to South Korea, the enterovirus 68 that causes neurological disease in children, the bacterial cause of paratyphoid fever and other pathogens for which we do not have vaccines for human use (Table 1) . One can argue about the content of the list or the priority of one candidate or another. However, decisions regarding funding could be made by committees of experts using collected information. The difficulties of making vaccines under emergency conditions, with the medical, legal, ethical and regulatory constraints of good practice were amply demonstrated in the recent Ebola crisis. When new agents are discovered they can be considered for investment in vaccine development. If a profitable market for a vaccine developed using the fund's money becomes evident, the manufacturer may sell it according to a prearranged formula that rewards the fund and maintains a reasonable price.

During the SARS outbreak, 21% of the infected individuals globally were healthcare workers. 15 In Canada, a final count of 251 cases of SARS was confirmed; 43% of them were healthcare workers, the majority were from Toronto. 15 Concerns were raised about infections in healthcare workers despite apparently appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Analysis of this experience uncovered several important lessons. 19 First, the protection of healthcare workers is not just about PPE; it encompasses all principles of infection prevention and control. 20 Whilst the initial focus for protecting anaesthesiologists or personnel involved in aerosol-generating medical procedures (tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manual ventilation before intubation, and bronchoscopy) was on the need for more stringent PPE, such as powered air-purifying respirators or double gloves during the SARS outbreak, further investigation did not support a risk of transmission with tracheal intubation if appropriate precautions and more standard PPE were used. 21 22 In areas, such as the emergency department or ICU where SARS patients were managed, there were 'uncontrolled situations characterized by multiple opportunities for extensive contamination and staff exposure prior to the intubation event'. 21 Healthcare workers were exposed to risk of infection before PPE was used. It reflects the importance of triage, early recognition, and prompt isolation for suspected cases of infected patients. 20 Second, a post-SARS investigation interviewing healthcare workers involved in the intubation of SARS patients in Toronto highlighted non-compliance or sub-optimal adherence to the use of PPE. 23 Although much is unknown about the 2019-nCoV, it is believed to spread from person to person amongst close contact via respiratory droplets and contact transmission. Strict adherence to the use of PPE, including procedure mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves, is highly effective in limiting droplet and contact transmission. 21 The current WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for the protection of personnel during aerosol-generating medical procedures in patients with confirmed/suspected 2019-nCoV centres around principles of clear communication, minimising personnel in the room during the procedure, appropriate use of PPE, and avoidance of procedures that generate high amounts of aerosols. Some considerations are provided as follows to help prepare for airway management of confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients. 20 24 25 These suggestions are by no means comprehensive. Hospitals should develop local plans for aerosolgenerating medical procedures in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients using a collaborative approach that engages anaesthesiologists, intensivists, emergency medicine physicians, respiratory therapists, resuscitation team members, infection prevention and control, occupational health and safety specialists, and environmental services staff.

Coronaviruses are classified phylogenetically into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronaviruses include human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), and CCoV. Four human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), as well as CRCoV, are Betacoronaviruses, but belong to different subgroups. Phylogenetically, CCoV is closely related to HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, while CRCoV is close to BCoV and HCoV-OC43.

The control of the route of transmission is another effective means of epidemic control. Infections of healthcare workers and family clusters suggest that 2019-nCoV has the ability to spread from human to human. Although the seafood market has been closed, the number of confirmed cases continues to gradually increase ( Fig. 1 B) . This further supports the conclusion that this virus can spread by human-to-human contact. Previous research has shown that coronaviruses usually have an ability to rapidly mutate. 9 We cannot exclude the possibility that some 2019-nCoVs will mutate to become "super-spreaders", as seen in SARS. Frequent disinfection of people-intensive places and animal trading markets should help stop the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, the outbreak has cast a shadow over the celebrations for the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25. Millions of people in China travel over the course of the Spring Festival, both within the country and overseas. In addition, millions of college students (Wuhan has more than 1 million college students) will return to school after the winter vacation. This large-scale population migration could lead to further spread of this virus. Therefore, it is possible that this epidemic will be more serious after the Spring Festival. At present, the National Health Commission of China ( http://www.nhc.gov.cn ) has listed 2019-nCoV as Class B infectious disease and managed as Class A. Measures including the temperature monitoring of passengers at railway stations, airports, terminals and other transportation hubs have been carried out, which should slow the spread of the virus to a certain extent. However these disease control policies are far from enough, more strict methods to control population flow should be on the table.

The epidemic dynamic network values are obtained via estimation methods such as sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm [22, 47] , Poisson and log-likelihood regression [22, 28, 47, 49, 51] , and Euler-Maruyama algorithm [47] , with uncertainties and approximations quantified by Bayesian analysis [46, 49, 51] . Most of the above-mentioned studies simulated the Wuhan epidemic dynamic network by utilizing a deterministic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model that categorizes the population into four states: susceptible individuals (S), asymptomatic individuals during the incubation period (E), confirmed infectious individuals (I), and recovered individuals (R). A SEIRDC model enhanced from the standard SEIR model by introducing dead and auxiliary variable (DC) [50] is also used for COVID-19 investigation. A geological-stratified debiasing approach is incorporated into the SEIRDC model to include the latent infection ratio (L&I) amongst the people traveling from Wuhan to other destinations in mainland China to improve the overall epidemiological estimation of the coronavirus.

An observation on January 20, 2020, showed that the infection had sharply increased in the span of a few days, reaching a total of 440 confirmed cases, of which 15 were medical workers associated with previous patients hosting the SARS-CoV-2 [17] . In another study carried out by Chan et al., six family members who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, China, were monitored. Five of them were tested positive for the COVID-19, despite not having come in contact with any of the markets or animals in Wuhan where the outbreak is believed-although not definitively-to have started. An additional family member was also reported to have contracted the disease several days after coming in contact with four of the family members. This observation further reinforces the fact that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from a human host to another human host [37] . This also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to undergo mutation and adapt to infecting human hosts more easily than before, creating the urgency to find methods to contain the mutation. A method of predicting whether or not these mutations will lead to further infectivity in the future is available but has yet to be conducted and validated [17] .

COVID-19 disease was occurred in the end of 2019 at Wuhan region of China. COVID-19 disease showed fever, cough, fatigue, and myalgias in human body during early phases (1) . The patients had abnormal situations in their CT chest images. The respiratory problems, heart damages, and secondary infection situations were observed as complications of the disease. The findings showed that COVID-19 virus spreads from person to person. The infected person needs to be treated in intensive care unit. The infected people have serious respiratory problems. The CT images of the infected people shows that COVID-19 disease has own characteristics. Therefore, the clinical experts need lung CT images to diagnose the COVID-19 in early phase. COVID-19 patients and 300 new COVID-19 patients for validation in their study. They obtained Dice similarity coefficient as 91.6%.

Microarray data from SARS CoV2 patients helps to construct a gene network relating to this disease. Analysis of these genes, present in network, highlights their biological functions and related cellular pathways. With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal cells with p= 1.37e−05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix. So, small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease. Understanding the human host response against this virus is very important to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV 2.

Virus particles can spread through the host body by two distinct methods. First method is diffusion through extracellular matrix and the second one is by using direct cell to cell contact [29] . Viruses which are transmitted across tight cell to cell contacts, are reached to neighborhood cells and extracellular matrix via host cell surface receptors. Thus, their binding efficiency and entry inside the host cell are increased manifolds. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell transmission. Basal cell of epithelial cell layer is attached with basal membrane through cell to cell junction points. Among three junction points in cell to cell contact in human body, in SARS CoV2 infection, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. Integrin proteins which binds to laminin proteins, are present in extracellular matrix, form hemidesmosome structure. Thus, focal adhesion pathway is affected in this cell to cell virus transmission. Although HCV and HIV viruses, transmit through tight junctions and gap junctions but SARS CoV2 virus transmits by using anchoring junction points. Here, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell are used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix. The precise protein receptor i.e. ACE2 can be used as target for possible therapeutics in SARS CoV2 treatment and at the time small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease.

The COVID-19 outbreak is caused by a newly identified member of a large family of viruses known as coronaviruses (name deriving from the Latin word corona, meaning crown) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] this family of viruses causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). These viruses were originally transmitted from animals to people. SARS, first recognized in mid-March 2003 [2] , was transmitted from civet cats to humans, while MERS, first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [3] , moved to humans from a type of camel. The novel coronavirus, identified by Chinese authorities on January 7 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, as it has been named by the WHO, seems to be closely related to bat and pangolin coronaviruses, but a final confirmation has not yet been given [4] . People may catch COVID-19 by close contact with infected people, via small droplets produced when they cough, sneeze, talk, or by touching a contaminated surface and then their face. According to the WHO, symptoms of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Notwithstanding the fact that infected patients can also be asymptomatic, in the more severe cases, the virus can lead to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death. The number of fatalities from the new coronavirus has overwhelmingly overtaken the toll of the SARS outbreak but its percentage remains considerably lower compared to the 10 percent of SARS and 30 percent of MERS.

SARS is the first transmissible pandemic disease of previously unknown etiology identified in the 21 st century. In November 2002, an unusual atypical pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV first occurred in Foshan City Guangdong Province, China (Cheng et al., 2007) , and the virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a 65-year-old doctor who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou. Subsequently, the infection spread to more than 30 different countries, including North America, Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia, resulting in a global outbreak with 8096 cases and 774 deaths. The fatality rate was nearly 10% in 2002-2003, having substantial economic effects (Drosten et al., 2003) . Investigation of live-animal markets in China indicated that the animal-to-human interface provided a mechanism for SARS-CoV to adapt to human-to-human transmission. SARS has been recognized as a global threat; although the outbreak of SARS was halted in 2004 through epidemiological measures, recent identification of bat SARS-like CoVs that can recognize human angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and replicate efficiently in primate cells indicates the inevitability of a SARS-CoV-like virus reemergence event in the near future (Guan et al., 2003) .

Ever since their discovery in the late 1960s, coronaviruses able to infect humans were neglected by the international medical community. However, when a variant emerged from animals in Southeast Asia to cause the first pandemic of the twentyfirst century: the severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, these apparently innocuous viruses suddenly became ''more interesting.'' Indeed, the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic was caused by a coronavirus variant that appears to have emerged from a bat reservoir to infect palm civets, sold live in open markets, which served as intermediate reservoirs before crossing into humans. Moreover in the fall of 2012, 10 years after the SARS episode, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the international medical community, that a SARS-like disease affected individuals that traveled from the Arabian Peninsula to the United Kingdom, which may indicate a possible resurgence of SARS. However, using molecular sequencing, it was rapidly shown that this new respiratory coronavirus was genetically different from SARS-CoV, underlining the importance of a molecular approach in making a viral diagnostic. It is now recognized that the new epidemic is caused by a new coronavirus from the genus Betacoronavirus that was first named HCoV-EMC (for Human Coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center), human betacoronavirus 2c, and NCoV or nCoV (for novel Coronavirus), and that is now known under the official name MERS-CoV: the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [50] . As of August 30, 2013, WHO indicated that the MERS-CoV has spread to eight different countries, where 108 laboratory-confirmed cases of individuals have been identified as infected by the MERS-CoV, with 50 deaths [70] .

Position 614 on the Spike and position 4715 on the Polyprotein covary in a significant way (data not shown). The most likely explanation for this is the rapid sequential fixation of both mutations in the same strain, together with the absence of recombinations in between the two. The two adjacent sites in the Nucleocapsid sequences show a perfect agreement in the time profiles, strongly suggesting that they happened together or within a short time. These two mutations respectively remove and add an Arginine (passing from RG to KR); by considering the overall frequencies of the possible amino acid pairs at these positions, we suggest that the second Arginine may complement the loss of the first one. Indeed, RR is never observed, KG is extremely rare (relative frequency, r.f.= 0.00036), while most genomes either present the original pair RG (r.f.= 0.87464) or KR (r.f.= 0.12500). We speculate that this could indeed be a consequence of the non-neutrality of configurations with no Arginine at both positions, an information still not giving hints on the fitness of the fixed variant. Next,we reasoned that grouping all the sequences uploaded from different countries may provide a picture averaged over variable and more complicated situations that might characterize the evolution of the virus within different countries or geographical areas. We therefore explored the time profiles of the variants in different geographical macro-regions ( Figure  4 and Figure 5 ) highlighting a highly heterogeneous situation. We also provide a movie illustrating the changes taking place in variant frequencies across overlapping time windows in macro-regions (Supplementary Movie 1), which provides a dynamical view of the time profiles of the variants. Figure 4 shows that D614G in China never reaches significant frequency while it increased quite rapidly in several areas where it arrived and where it often started at very low frequency with respect to the original haplotype. If a functional role for this mutation will be demonstrated, this pattern seems to indicate that different variants might have different fitness when interacting with different host's haplotypes, i.e. in case Asian and European have different haplotypes concerning some of the proteins interacting with the Spike, like for instance Furin. To conclude, it is clear that since the first appearance of D614G and other of the above variants, their relative frequency underwent a significant increase in several countries, most of the time overcoming in prevalence the original variant(s), except for China, South Asia, South America and Africa. In Figure 6 we summarize the most recent situation, by using sequences from the interval April 10 to 20, 2020.

The recent outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-COV-2 has led to a worldwide pandemic (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020) with substantial social, health and economic costs ( UN News, 2020) . The epidemic spread quickly from Wuhan to the neighbouring cities and then to the rest of China , possibly exacerbated by the 'travel rush' for the Lunar New Year. On 23 rd January 2020, the Chinese government initiated an unprecedented move of introducing a 'metropolitan-wide quarantine' of the city of Wuhan, by terminating all public transportation in the city and intercity links (Chen et al., 2020, Zhang Lei et al., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2020). Within days of implementing this quarantine, an additional 12 major cities in Hubei province were also similarly quarantined (Sina news, 2020) . Within a week of the quarantine, all 31 provinces of mainland China initiated the highest level of public health emergency response (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) . The strict control nationwide has been highly effective (Chinazzi et al., 2020 , Pan et al., 2020 , Tian et al., 2020 , with the daily reported confirmed cases significantly reduced from 3000-4000 at its peak to 10 cases or less a day in mid-March (World Health Organization, 2020a). The COVID-19 epidemic had evolved into a worldwide pandemics. As of 24 th May, over 5,200,000 cases have been reported in over 200 countries. The epicentre has moved from China to Europe, to the United States, and now to South America (World Health Organization, 2020a).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified coronavirus which has spread from China to the rest of the world causing the pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). It has fatality rate that floats from 5 to 15% and the symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia and/or fatigue up to dyspnea, responsible for hospitalization and in most of the cases of artificial oxygenation. In the attempt to understand how the virus spreads and how to pharmacologically abolish it, it was highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by means of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ). Once bound to its receptor ACE2, the other two proteases, in concert with the receptor-mediated signaling, allow virus replication and spread throughout the body. Our attention has been focused on the role of ACE2 in that its blockade by the virus increases Bradykinin and its metabolites, well known to facilitate inflammation in the lung (responsible for cough and fever), facilitate both the coagulation and complement system, three mechanisms that are typical of angioedema, cardiovascular dysfunction and sepsis, pathologies which symptoms occur in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we propose to pharmacologically block the kallikrein-kinin system upstream bradykinin and the ensuing inflammation, coagulation and complement activation by means of lanadelumab, which is a clinically approved drug for hereditary angioedema.

Our results suggest that the propensity of SARS-CoV-2 to spread from person to person within an indoor environment characterized by obliged closed contacts is low, provided ordinary PPE are used and routine sanitation procedures are implemented. It should be noted that the time index cases remained at work after the event of contagion could only be estimated based on known average incubation times, i.e. 5 days [5] . In addition, the analysed sample size is relatively low and comes from a tertiary-care hospital not directly involved in triage of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Finally, because of the short time of index patient circulation after symptom onset, the actual intensity (number and duration) of contacts was probably limited.

The majority (60.3%) of these emerging infectious diseases (EID) originated from (wild) animal reservoirs, and approximately one in five was transmitted from animal reservoir hosts to humans by disease vectors (ticks, mosquitos, midges) [1] . Pathogen discovery programs sampling wildlife hosts that are considered major reservoirs for EID (rodents, bats) have identified tremendous enzootic virus diversity, confirming their potential as sources of novel human pathogens [2] . Since 2008, the discovery of severe fever with thrombocytopenia virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as unusual outbreaks of Zika virus, yellow fever and Ebola highlight the importance of demographic change, global travel and trade, and possibly climate change as drivers for emergence [3e7] (http://www.promedmail.org/, archive no. 20140322.2349696 2014-03 -22) .

In humans, viral infections of the respiratory tract are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several recognized respiratory viral agents have a neuroinvasive capacity since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases. Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans and animals. Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds. However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, they can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, or even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The respiratory involvement of HCoV has been clearly established since the 1960s. In addition, for almost three decades now, the scientific literature has also demonstrated that HCoV are neuroinvasive and neurotropic and could induce an overactivation of the immune system, in part by participating in the activation of autoreactive immune cells that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals. Furthermore, it was shown that in the murine CNS, neurons are the main target of infection, which causes these essential cells to undergo degeneration and eventually die by some form of programmed cell death after virus infection. Moreover, it appears that the viral surface glycoprotein (S) represents an important factor in the neurodegenerative process. Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these recognized human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurological diseases for which the etiology remains unknown or poorly understood.

The AnyLogic simulation package is a powerful tool for the analysis of system dynamics [70] , which has been extensively used for analysis and prediction of epidemic spread [71, 72] . In this research, a SEIR model was built up in AnyLogic. The model input was, to our best, the information collected at the time of the case study (February 9th). In addition, several assumptions were made in order to predict the future disease spread tendency in Wuhan. The initial infections were set to 41, which was the reported number until January 11th [7] . The basic reproduction rate of the COVID-19, which depicts the average number of secondary infections caused by one patient to all susceptible population throughout the whole course of its infection [14] , was set to 2.68 in Wuhan [6] . The incubation period of the COVID-19 was set to 7 days [73] . The average length of stay in hospital was set to two to three weeks [74] and the probability of contact infection was assumed to be 0.4. Taking into account the fact that Wuhan has been placed on effective lockdown since January 23th, 2020, the inbound and outbound transportation has been effectively cut off and the mobility of people within the city has been drastically restricted, so the disease may only be spread within a flexible domain of susceptible population. Due to this reason, the size of susceptible population was estimated with the best fit of the real data at the time of the case study, as shown in Figure 2a . The repetition of the simulation was set to 20 times and the confidence level was set to be within 10%.

Then, the number of infections may be reduced continuously from the beginning of March. Based on the prediction, the planning of six consecutive periods was performed with each period includes 10 days. By February 8th, 28 hospitals had been opened for the patients infected by the COVID-19 and two temporary hospitals have been established at Huoshenshan and Leishenshan [75] .

Although it is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted from infected animals (civet cat, snake, or other species) to humans at the Huanan seafood market or not, there is a clear possibility for animal-to-human transmission (44) . Ferrets, cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (45) . It has been demonstrated that cats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and transmit it to other cats. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear if cats can transmit the virus to their owners; so at present this not a problem for cat owners. Moreover, ducks, pigs, chickens, and dogs are not likely to be infected. However, it should be mentioned that a German shepherd pet dog died (the cause of death could not be determined as the owner declined to conduct an autopsy) two days after the owner was in COVID-19 quarantine (46) . So, possible animal-to-human transmission of the virus must be taken into account.

One practical application of the phylogenetic network is to reconstruct infection paths where they are unknown and pose a public health risk. The following cases where the infection history is well documented may serve as illustrations (SI Appendix). On 25 February 2020, the first Brazilian was reported to have been infected following a visit to Italy, and the network algorithm reflects this with a mutational link between an Italian and his Brazilian viral genome in cluster C (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). In another case, a man from Ontario had traveled from Wuhan in central China to Guangdong in southern China and then returned to Canada, where he fell ill and was conclusively diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on 27 January 2020. In the phylogenetic network (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ), his virus genome branches from a reconstructed ancestral node, with derived virus variants in Foshan and Shenzhen (both in Guangdong province), in agreement with his travel history. His virus genome now coexists with those of other infected North Americans (one Canadian and two Californians) who evidently share a common viral genealogy. The case of the single Mexican viral genome in the network is a documented infection diagnosed on 28 February 2020 in a Mexican traveler to Italy. Not only does the network confirm the Italian origin of the Mexican virus (SI Appendix, Fig.  S3 ), but it also implies that this Italian virus derives from the first documented German infection on 27 January 2020 in an employee working for the Webasto company in Munich, who, in turn, had contracted the infection from a Chinese colleague in Shanghai who had received a visit by her parents from Wuhan. This viral journey from Wuhan to Mexico, lasting a month, is documented by 10 mutations in the phylogenetic network.

The term highly infectious diseases (HID) defines mostly viral and bacterial infections that (i) are easily transmissible from person to person; (ii) cause a life-threatening clinical illness with no or few treatment options; and (iii) pose a threat for both health care workers and the public, thus requiring specific infection control measures and public health planning [1] . Included in this definition are viral haemorrhagic fevers (e.g. Filo-, Arena-or Bunyavirus infections); some respiratory syndromes (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus, or pneumonic plague); as well as any (re2) emerging infectious agent transmissible from person-to-person [2] . In Europe, HIDs have caused several events within the last decade: SARS affected eight European nations in 2003; Lassa virus has repeatedly been imported to Europe; and Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus infections are increasing in several Mediterranean regions, and have also been imported to central Europe and the United Kingdom (UK) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Recently detected agents like the new human Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus underline the continuous challenge faced [8] .

In December 2019, cases of undiagnosed pneumonia started being reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. On January 9 2020, the Chinese authorities indicated that a novel CoV was associated with the severe respiratory disease. The first patient with unexplained pneumonia, identified in December 8 2019, came from Wuhan South China Seafood Market. Initially, other patients were linked to the same seafood and live animal market, suggesting an animal origin for the initial spread to humans. Subsequent investigations revealed that the crowded seafood market only boosted circulation of the novel CoV and spread it to the whole city in early December 2019, whereas based on the genome data the virus likely began spreading from person to person in early December or even as early as late November. The first documented human case has been dated back to November 17 2019.

The novel corona virus has caused a pandemic in early 2020. The reproduction rate of the corona virus is estimated to be between 1.4 and 3.9 [2] . From an infected patient, COVID spreads to 1.4 to 3.9 others on an average. As the virus spreads through respiratory droplets, it spreads at an exponential rate, especially, in densely populated locations. The infected patients become carriers at an early stage even before the onset of symptoms [3] . Thus, it becomes imperative to test a large number of people and identify early stage infections to contain the spread of COVID-19. The PCR based testing is considered to be one of the best techniques for early stage diagnosis [4] . Group testing is well known methodology in the combinatorics and compressed sensing literature [5] . In group testing(GT), multiple samples are pooled together to form groups (fewer in number than the total number of samples). Tests are performed on these groups and from the outcome of these tests, the infected samples are inferred. Group testing relies on the fact that not all of the tested samples may be infected. Thus, by employing group testing for COVID-19 diagnosis, the number of samples tested can be increased, the tests performed can be made economical and the speed of detection can be improved. This can lead to efficient containment of the spread of COVID-19.

Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of infectious disease during the first 90 days of life, particularly factors affecting serum immunoglobulin concentration. In a study of 122 dairy herds in south-west Sweden, Svensson et al. (2003) clinically monitored the health of 3081 heifer calves from birth until 90 days of age. 23% of the calves developed one or more diseases during this period. Most of the 317 diarrhoea cases were mild (68%) whereas of the 221 cases of respiratory disease 43% were severe. The total morbidity was 0.081 cases per calf-month at risk and the incidence rates of arthritis, diarrhoea, omphalophlebitis, respiratory disease and ringworm were 0.002, 0.035, 0.005, 0.025 and 0.009 cases per calf-month at risk respectively. Odds ratios were calculated for severe diarrhoea in calves born in the summer (OR: 1.7) and receiving colostrums through suckling instead of a bucket or nipple (OR: 1.8). It has been shown that calves left with their mothers have a delayed/longer time to ingest colostrum and often fail to ingest adequate volumes (Rajala and Castrén, 1995) . Svensson and Liberg (2006) found that the health status of the mother cow 280-50 days before calving, length of dry period, retained placenta and somatic cell count were predisposing risk factors for respiratory disease in the calf. Svensson et al. (2003) were also able to demonstrate that the odds ratios for respiratory disease and increased respiratory sounds were increased in calves housed in large group pens with an automatic milk-feeding system (OR: 2.2 and 2.8). Similar results have been reported by Maatje et al. (1993) and Plath (1999) . There was a decreased odds ratio for respiratory disease if calving was supervised (OR: 0.7) . If birth was taking place in individual maternity pens or in tie stalls instead of in cubicle or group maternity pen, the odds ratio for increased respiratory sounds was 0.5 or 0.6 respectively. 30% of the diarrhoea cases were treated with antibiotics whereas 47% of the respiratory cases were treated using antibiotics. In another study of nine farms, Svensson and Liberg (2006) found that in pens for six to nine calves there was a significantly reduced risk of clinical respiratory tract disease (OR: 0.69-0.72) compared with pens with 12-18 calves and there was also an association with the age at transfer to the group pen. The risk of diarrhoea was not affected by housing the calves in differently sized groups. However, calves housed in large sized groups grew significantly less quickly (approximately 40 g/day) than calves housed in groups of six to nine. Serological responses to respiratory viruses (e.g. bovine respiratory syncytical virus, parainfluenza virus, corona virus and viral diarrhoea virus) showing that animals within a herd are usually either all seropositive or all seronegative, indicate that infections spread to all calves in the herd when introduced or activated (Hägglund et al., in press) and hence that aerosol is an important means for the spread of viruses. However, an infected animal is not equivalent to a diseased animal. It has been shown that calves housed in adjacent pens can maintain quite different levels of disease. Svensson and Liberg (2006) reported that calves in a group of 16 had a significantly higher incidence of clinical respiratory disease that calves in an adjacent pen kept in groups of 8. Engelbrecht (2005) reported calves transferred to group pens in a batchwise manner had significantly higher prevalence of diarrhoea and respiratory disease than calves in adjacent pens that were transferred to and from the group pen continuously. In both studies calves had no direct contact with calves in adjacent pens. These results indicate an important role of direct contact for the transmission of respiratory disease and hence the importance in disease control of decreasing direct contact between calves within the same building by means of solid walls. Svensson and Liberg (2006) also reported that the age at transfer from single pens to group pens was associated with the risk of respiratory disease, indicating that delaying transfer to after two weeks of age might be preferable for health reasons.

One of the most difficult issues concerned reports that U.S. officials were investigating the possibility the coronavirus was secretly 'manufactured' and/or 'escaped' from a Chinese lab in Wuhan, specifically the Wuhan Institute of Virology. There is no scientific evidence to support these theories. The sequencing and analysis of coronavirus genomes have already dispelled these rumors and instead demonstrate that bats are the likeliest source, suggesting that COVID-19 was created by nature, not humans. At its molecular level, the viral genome most closely resembles an isolate that already exists in horseshoe bats in Hunan province. Supported by several studies, bats have an unusually high capacity to harbor viruses and have been linked to past outbreaks, including SARS, MERS and Ebola. The virus may have spread from bats to an intermediary animal before infecting humans; this remains unclear. The fact that the earliest cases of COVID-19 were linked to a live animal market in Wuhan that sold exotic species only bolsters these observations.

The neuroinvasive potential of CoV has been reported in SARS-CoV-1 patients and experimental animals, and spread from the respiratory tract to the CNS could occur via retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerves such as the olfactory nerve, or via hematogenous spread (Desforges et al., 2019) . After entering the CNS, CoV has been shown to induce neuronal cell death in mice (Netland et al., 2008) . Further, mice infected with HCoV-OC43 develop chronic encephalitis, marked by viral persistence in neurons and behavioral abnormalities (Jacomy et al., 2006) . It has been speculated that the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, particularly of medullary structures involved in respiration (e.g., solitary tract nucleus, nucleus ambiguus), may partially mediate the high incidence of respiratory failure currently seen in COVID-19 (Y. C. Li et al., 2020) , which requires further investigation. Recent articles also, discuss routes and mechanisms of CoV neurotropism (Vavougios, 2020; Yeshun Wu et al., 2020) .

One way to determine the type of virus is the identification of specific viral antigens in Western blot tests. For this purpose, the proteins of infected cells or virus particles which were previously pelleted by ultracentrifugation are separated by electrophoresis on a sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel. Their pattern and molecular masses can provide evidence for the type of virus. However, a final assignment is only possible serologically in the Western blot ( Fig. 13 .1). For this purpose, the separated proteins are transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane (actual Western blot) and then incubated with antisera containing immunoglobulins, which specifically react with the viral antigens of interest (primary antibody).

Sera from people who have withstood an infection with the corresponding virus type, and thus have produced specifically binding antibodies, can also be used. The nitrocellulose membranes are then treated with other so-called secondary antibodies, which are specific to the Fc regions of the primary antibody; e.g. with immunoglobulins from swine, which were inoculated with Fc regions of murine antibody molecules, and have developed an immune response against murine antibodies. Human antibodies are usually detected with rabbit immunoglobulins, which bind to the Fc regions of human IgG. The different enzymes necessary for the further detection reactions are Fig. 13 .1 Example for the detection of viral proteins. (a) Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel.

In the area of protein bands to which the antibody complexes have bound, a brown precipitate is produced indicating a positive response (Courtesy of Andreas Gigler, Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Regensburg, Germany) covalently bound to the secondary antibody, e.g. horseradish peroxidase. These secondary antibodies interact with the antigen-antibody complexes on the membranes, and in the next step, they are detected by adding the appropriate substrate, in this case diaminobenzidine. In the positive case, brownish protein bands arise ( Fig. 13.1) . Alternatively, the use of alkaline phosphatase for labelling produces a blue colour.

Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are associated with both enteric and systemic diseases in domestic and wild Felidae. The feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is an ubiquitous enteropathogenic virus, replicating in epithelial cells of both small and large intestine after oral uptake [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The mild enteritis caused by this replication is usually unapparent or is manifested by a transient diarrhoea in young kittens [3] . Around 13% of all infected cats are not able to clear the virus [6] . In these cats, the virus persists for several months or even years in the epithelium of the large intestine [2] [3] [4] [5] 7] . Since FECVs are easily transmitted from cat to cat by faecal-oral route, they are enzootic among most cat populations [3, 8] . Although FECV-infections manifest subclinically, they may be the start of a lethal outcome. During replication, mutations can occur in the viral genome, providing the virus with tools to productively replicate in monocytes/macrophages [9] [10] [11] [12] . This mutational variant, designated feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), causes a chronic and highly fatal systemic disease, FIP, characterized by a diffuse pyogranulomatous (peri)phlebitis and serositis in presence (wet form) or absence (dry form) of fibrinous exudate in the affected body cavities [13] [14] [15] . In contrast to FECV which is highly infectious but seldom causes disease, FIPV shows a low infectivity but high mortality (95-100%) [16] . Losses from FIP are typically unpredictable and occur in only a restricted fraction (< 10%) of all seropositive cats [6, [16] [17] [18] . However, the lack of tools to successfully prevent and control the disease has an enormous financial, emotional and ethical impact, and makes FIP the most feared infectious cause of death in cats [19] . To date, it remains unknown why FECV and FIPV show such a clinically (mild enteritis versus FIP) and epidemiologically (easy versus restricted transmission) different behaviour.

Social distancing involved keeping a distance of 1.5 m between people, which can prevent the spread of most respiratory infectious diseases. Social distancing is one of the most effective measures to reduce the spread of the virus, which is transmitted by air droplets. The droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or forced speaking have a certain transmission distance. By keeping this distance, we can reduce the spread of the virus. Wearing masks, washing hands frequently and disinfecting with alcohol also help to prevent the virus from spreading from one person to another. To control the disease, the World Health Organization recommended that countries should strengthen case detection, track and monitor contacts, practice isolation from close contacts and isolate cases as well as implement traffic control and suspend large gatherings. A novel coronavirus pneumonia prediction model was established by using the big data of the University of Washington Health Index and Evaluation Center (IHME) (IHME 2020). Analysis of the epidemic situation in seven locked down cities in Wuhan, Italy and Spain showed that maintaining social distancing really achieved results. Because these cities implemented lockdowns, the epidemic quickly reached a peak, so far not climbing again. Erin Mordecai, a biologist at Stanford University, and a team of researchers developed an interactive simulator to simulate the spread of COVID-19 over time, demonstrating the role of social isolation and social distancing in epidemic control (Erin 2020) .

The contact rate is the rate of infection from an infected individual to a susceptible contact on the unitary time step d . The number of individuals transferred from the susceptible state to the exposed state is • • Δ . The force of infection is defined as * ( )/ , which is the number of new infections divided by the Italian population. At the same time step, there are ( )Δ number of cases that are transferred from the exposed to infectious compartment, and ( )Δ number of cases transferred from the infectious compartment to "removed". It is important to state that we assumed a closed population, which means the population is fixed with no births, no deaths, and no introduction of new individuals. From the above ODE system, [ ( ) + ( ) + ( ) + ( )] = 0, which means that the population N is constant at any time step : S( ) + ( ) + ( ) + ( ) = for any ≥ 0 .The individuals in the exposed state are infected but not yet infectious. The population is well-mixed, and the model assumes that the latent and infectious times of the pathogen are exponentially distributed. In this letter, contact rate is changing over time as "S" (susceptible): the portion of the population that does not have any vax coverage or immunity; "E" (exposed): the portion of the population that has been infected but is in the incubation period that does not infect other individuals;

An outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus began (officially) in Argentina in March 9, 2020, with the number of newly reported cases still increasing (the time of writing is May 21, 2020). Most of the mathematical models to simulate an epidemic divide the population into classes and assumptions about the time rate of transfer from one class to another (Hethcote, 2000; Brauer, 2017) . We refer to Hethcote (2000) , Keeling and Rohani (2008) and Diekmann et al. (2013) for detailed mathematical analyses of this kind of models. Here, we use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model consisting of a first-order in time system of ODE's, to describe the spread of the virus, compute the number of infected individuals, including the IFR to model the death toll. It is important to clarify that the E class is infected but has not the symptoms of the disease, because they are incubating it. They will have symptoms when they pass to class I. Individuals in class I may not have symptoms (asymptomatic), but they are infectious, while those in class E are not.

Phylogenetic analysis-investigations of the complete S gene nucleotide sequences of SARS CoV shows that these novel coronaviruses clustered into two distinct sublineages. The first one only contains viruses isolated from Guangzhou (GZ01, GZ43, and GZ60). The second includes SARS CoV isolates from other regions after SARS spread. Of note is that GZ50 also joined the second sublineage, but still kept an outgroup relation with all other SARS CoV from other regions (figure 4), suggesting that GZ50 might be the prototype of SARS CoV noted in other regions. The phylogenetic relation matches with the disease spread pathway-ie, from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, and then other regions.

Dental staff, like other healthcare providers, may be exposed to COVID-19 as part of their work, as the virus can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth [2] . In dental practice, the possible routes of transmission for COVID-19, or SARS-CoV-2, include airborne spread via aerosols formed during dental procedures [3] , contact spread, and contaminated surfaces spread [4] . Moreover, dental staff may be conflicted about performing their professional roles as health care providers versus their roles as family members (e.g., spouse/parents). According to Maunder et al. [5] , the conflict of altruism and professional liability, on the one hand, with fear and blame for potentially endangering their relatives to a highly infectious agent, on the other hand, was a tremendous burden for many medical staff individuals during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak.

Mathematical epidemic models have been extensively used to describe the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, especially on the population level [1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 20] . As directly transmitted infections transmit from infected to susceptible (irrespective of the degree of susceptibility) individuals, it is important to model the interaction between infected and non-infected individuals in the population. The term describing this interaction is called "incidence term". In some models, this term has been assumed either in mass-action [1, 5] or standard incidence form [3, 10, 12] . In other models, it is assumed in a saturated incidence [4, 19, 29] or a Holling-type form [26] . Other non-linear incidence forms are also considered in the literature [15] . Here, motivated by an SIR model for a demographically stationary population, a new incidence function that takes into account heterogeneity between infected and non-infected individuals has been introduced, differentiating between the time activity of infected and non-infected individuals in the population. Equilibrium, stability and cross-sectional analyses of the model have been done. Also, the possibility to contain an infection represented by the model with a strategy based either on vaccinating a proportion p of newborns or on treating infected individuals has been studied. In the case of herd immunity, an exact formula for the critical vaccination coverage level p c required to eliminate the infection has been computed in terms of the percent reduction in contact time activity of infected individuals P. Throughout the analysis, we concluded that the higher the percent reduction in infected individuals contact-activity time is, the lower the critical vaccination coverage required to eliminate the infection is (i.e., the higher the percent reduction in the critical vaccination coverage required to eliminate the infection is) which in turn reduces the cost of vaccination needed to protect the population from the infection.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the pathogen to cause pneumonia in Wuhan, China , which was temporarily named as 2019-nCoV by WHO. 1,2 On 11 February 2020, based on the phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, 2019-nCoV was officially named as SARS-CoV-2, 3 and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19. 4 SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets and close contact , posing a huge public health challenge. 5 So far, there were more than a million confirmed cases in 181 countries and regions around the world. 6 The main manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, dry cough, weakness, and breathing difficulty. Abnormality in liver function tests has been reported; almost one-half of patients experience different degrees of liver test abnormalitities. 7, 8 According to a recent study using single-cell RNA sequencing , angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE)2 was highly expressed not only in type II alveolar epithelial cells, but also in bile duct cells. 9 Importantly, recent studies confirmed that ACE2 receptor is the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2.. . 10 All these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the bile duct cells and cause the abnormal liver function in these patients. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the bile duct injury marker, is not specific to COVID-19. 7, 8 A recent study reported that moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were present in liver biopsy specimens, indicating that the liver injury could be caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 11 Currently, however, there are no data to determine whether abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients is due to drug use or not. Given the highly contagious and pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the high incidence of liver damage, an in-depth evaluation of liver function in COVID patients is urgently warranted.

Similar to COVID-19, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was imported through Lagos airport. Within weeks, 19 people were diagnosed with Ebola across two states of Nigeria—Lagos and Rivers State—of whom eight died of Ebola.2 The dense population of Lagos, its overstrained infrastructure, and the fact that it is a major regional transit hub for air, land, and sea transport created the perfect conditions for the spread of Ebola. Nevertheless, Nigeria's aggressive and coordinated response successfully controlled the Ebola epidemic.

By March 9, 2020, 27 suspected cases had been identified across five states (Edo, Lagos, Ogun, Federal Capital Territory, and Kano), of which two were confirmed to be positive (ie, the index case and a contact), with no deaths.1 216 contacts were linked to the index case, 136 of whom are being followed up. Similar to COVID-19, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 was imported through Lagos airport. Within weeks, 19 people were diagnosed with Ebola across two states of Nigeria—Lagos and Rivers State—of whom eight died of Ebola.2 The dense population of Lagos, its overstrained infrastructure, and the fact that it is a major regional transit hub for air, land, and sea transport created the perfect conditions for the spread of Ebola. Nevertheless, Nigeria's aggressive and coordinated response successfully controlled the Ebola epidemic.

By January 28, 2020, a total of 4593 global confirmed cases, of which 4537 were from China, had been reported (1) . On January 30, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was declared as a global health emergency by World Health Organization (WHO). The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and organ invasion are unclear, which directly leads to difficulties and blindness in clinical diagnosis and treatment. We aim to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from urine, blood, anal swab and oropharyngeal swab samples. We hope to provide evidences of the multiple organ invasion of the virus and figure out its relation with clinical manifestations.

In addition to rodents, we also measured the SADS-CoV susceptibility of cell lines from humans, monkeys, chickens, and dogs, revealing a remarkably broad spectrum of tropism (Table 1 and Fig. 1) . As for the ability of SADS-CoV to grow efficiently in human cell lines, we should not underestimate the risk that this bat-origin CoV may "jump" from pigs to humans. It is noteworthy that camel workers with high rates of exposure to camel nasal and oral secretions had evidence of MERS-CoV infection (36) . Considering that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and spread from one species to another through intermediate hosts (civets and camels, respectively), SADS-CoV may pose a similar risk to human health through transmission from pigs or other susceptible hosts.

Methods We used data collected from routine care of all adults in 4 French hospitals with documented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and requiring oxygen ≥ 2 L/min to emulate a target trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of HCQ at 600 mg/day. The composite primary endpoint was transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) within 7 days from inclusion and/or death from any cause. Analyses were adjusted for confounding factors by inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results This study included 181 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia; 84 received HCQ within 48 hours of admission (HCQ group) and 97 did not (no-HCQ group). Initial severity was well balanced between the groups. In the weighted analysis, 20.2% patients in the HCQ group were transferred to the ICU or died within 7 days vs 22.1% in the no-HCQ group (16 vs 21 events, relative risk [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.80). In the HCQ group, 2.8% of the patients died within 7 days vs 4.6% in the no-HCQ group (3 vs 4 events, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.13-2.89), and 27.4% and 24.1%, respectively, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome within 7 days (24 vs 23 events, RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.65-2.00). Eight patients receiving HCQ (9.5%) experienced electrocardiogram modifications requiring HCQ discontinuation. Interpretation These results do not support the use of HCQ in patients hospitalised for documented SARS-CoV-2-positive hypoxic pneumonia.

Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are zoonotic pathogens and are believed to have been transmitted from a natural host, possibly bats, to humans through intermediate mammalian hosts 12, 13 . The key determinant of host specificity is the envelope-located trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein, which can be further cleaved by host proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit and a membrane-bound C-terminal S2 region 14 . The cleaved S protein remains non-convalently associated in the metastable pre-fusion conformation. After virus endocytosis by the host cell, a second cleavage is generated, which is mediated by endolysosomal proteases (S2 0 cleavage site), allowing membrane fusion activation to occur. In the S1 subunit, the receptor binding domain (RBD, also called the C terminal domain, CTD) is localized in the C-terminal region, spanning B200 amino acids, and structural studies have revealed that the RBD consists of two subdomains: the core and external subdomains [14] [15] [16] [17] . In the S2 subunit, the heptad repeat (HR) regions are also well characterized [18] [19] [20] , and as expected, the HR1 and HR2 of MERS-CoV fold into an intra-hairpin helical structure that can assemble trimerically into a six-helix bundle (a trimer of the HR1/HR2 heterodimer), demonstrating a classical type I membrane fusion process 21 . Peptide inhibitors have been designed targeting these HR regions and been proven to be effective in vitro and in vivo 18, 19, [22] [23] [24] . These studies have provided insight into the characteristics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S components; however, the overall S protein structures of these two highly pathogenic CoVs remain to be investigated. This will further enhance our understanding of S protein function and subsequent design of broadly neutralizing antibodies and vaccine immunogens.

When the source location is at the windward 18th floor, the tracer gas wouldn't disperse downward since the thermal plume and the airflow above the stagnation zone are both upward. The units on the leeward side are softly affected in Case I4. Overall, in the buoyancy lift governing cases (II-II3), the tracer gas mainly spreads from source unit to the upper ones on the windward side. In the two forces equivalent cases (II4), the tracer gas mainly disperses horizontally from windward side to leeward side. In the wind force ruling cases (II5-II8), the tracer gas mainly moves from the source unit to the lower ones on the windward side. Fig. 12 illustrates the tracer gas mass fraction distributions along the windward wall in each case of group II and group III. The overall tendency of group II is similar with that of group I, the close window mode. In the windless case II1, the velocity of vertical upward flow adjacent to the wall increases with height. So compared with the source location at 2nd floor, the tracer gas releasing from the 10th floor moves upward faster and has a longer vertical coverage. When the source is located at the 18th floor, the tracer gas covers a wider range at the horizontal direction in Case II7 where the wind force is ruling than that in II1 under buoyancy lift dominated condition. In group III, the temperature difference is 3.5 K. Under the same breeze condition, the vertical upward transmission in Case III1 is weaker than Case II1 due to the smaller thermal plume. In Case III5 and III7, the Ri number is less than 7, the wind force is predominant. With the source releasing from the 10th floor, the shape of tracer gas coverage is like raindrop as mentioned above and the breadth of the raindrop decreases from Case III5 to III7, while the raindrop length increases. The reason is the growing downward airflow speed below the stagnation zone.

(1) In a gentle breezy day, the tracer gas can spread vertically upward driven by thermal flow, from bottom to top in a high-rise building. The reentry ratio of the flat immediately above the source is around 25%. However, for the isothermal condition, the vertically upward transmission is only possible above the stagnation zone, and the reentry ratio can be up to more than 50%. For source location below the stagnation zone conditions, the pollutants disperse from the middle of the building to bottom with the downward flow in the isothermal cases. (2) As to the comparisons between the sunward and shady side, both of two surfaces are placed at the windward side. Take the gentle breeze cases as contrast objects, the results show that when the source is released from the bottom flat of the building, the vertical upward coverage length of tracer gas on the shady side surface is nearly half of that on the sunward surface. Both of the reentry ratio values of the flat immediately above the source are almost 20%. (3) In terms of the combined effect of wind and buoyancy forces, multiple cases are set for relevant analysis and investigation. The assigned dimensionless number, Ri, is helpful for summarizing the results. When the source location is above the stagnation zone, the pollutant always goes up with the rising airflow. Under the conditions of the source location below the stagnation zone, as the Ri number decreases, the effect of force convection strengthens, so the pollutant spread from lower floor to upper ones is weakened. As the source located at the 2nd floor, the vertical upgrade transmission is suppressed once Ri is lower than 40. When the source is released from the 10th floor, the vertical upward transmission is restrained once Ri is smaller than 20.

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus which spread from China in December 2019 led to severe health problems and fatalities worldwide, eventually turning into a global pandemic. The virus was named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) and the disease caused due to it was named the COrona VIrus Disease . The most common symptoms are cough and fever, although symptoms range in severity including pneumonia-like symptoms and dyspnea [1] . It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread through infected respiratory droplets transmitted from an infected person to a healthy person [2] . Other symptoms in humans have been studied, including relations to the gastrointestinal system [3] and skin rashes [4] .

Wild-type MERS CoV and two variants were isolated for the first time from a patient who had traveled from Korea to China. Genomic sequencing revealed 414-bp and 419-bp deletions between ORF5 and the E protein that would result in partial fusion or truncation of these proteins. Whether this finding is a special case or not needs to be investigated by sequencing more samples. Based on previous studies of E protein localization [23-25, 32, 33] , we conclude that the two variants might affect virus packaging, which could result in the attenuation of virulence and therefore be relevant for studies related to vaccine development, pathogenesis and viral evolution. 2012zx10004-213.

Objectives: COVID-19 began spreading widely in China in January 2020. Outpatient Fever Clinics (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution. Design: A population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC. Methods: The FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department (ED) were collected and analyzed. Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%, p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38 after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or medical care providers were cross-infected. Conclusion: The work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively prevented COVID-19 from spreading in the hospital as well as offload ED resources.

There have been various literatures on COVID-19 from different aspects, i.e., the origin of COVID-19, the clinical features as well as epidemic transmission characteristics. Specifically, for the origin of the virus, (Fan et al., 2019) and (Luk et al., 2019) pointed out that COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus closely related to SARS-CoV-2, while others believed that the COVID-19 virus was originally derived from wild animals (Huang et al., 2020; Benvenuto et al., 2020) . For the epidemic transmission characteristics, Holshue et al. (2020) and Hui et al.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic keeps the world in suspense. In addition to the fundamental challenges for the health care system, the individual departments must decide how to deal with patients at risk. Neurologists are confronted with the question, how they should advise their patients regarding immunosuppressive treatment. In particular, the large number of different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in the treatment of neuroimmunological diseases such as multiple sclerosis poses a challenge. To a limited extent, it might be useful to transfer knowledge from previous SARS- and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus outbreaks in 2002/2003 and 2012 to the current situation. Overall, immunosuppressive therapy does neither seem to have a major impact on infection with SARS- and MERS-CoV nor does it seem to lead to a severe disease course in many cases. Considering the immunological responses against infections with novel coronaviruses in humans, interferons, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide appear to be safe. As lymphopenia seems to be associated with a more severe disease course, all DMTs causing lymphopenia, such as cladribine, alemtuzumab, and dimethyl fumarate, need to be reviewed more thoroughly. As they are, in general, associated with a higher risk of infection, depleting anti-CD20 antibodies may be problematic drugs. However, it has to be differentiated between the depletion phase and the phase of immune reconstitution. In summary, previous coronavirus outbreaks have not shown an increased risk for immunocompromised patients. Patients with severe neuroimmunological diseases should be kept from hasty discontinuation of immunotherapy.

Enteroviruses include the polio, coxsackie A and B and echoviruses. These belong to the family of Picornaviridae. They contain singlestranded RNA. Poliomyelitis is rare in developed countries, as a result of the widespread use of oral polio vaccines, but continues to circulate in developing countries. Similarly, hepatitis A is an RNA virus and has the physicochemical characteristics of a typical enterovirus. It is transmitted from person to person by the faeco-oral route. Outbreaks may originate from viral contamination of food, water, milk and shellfish. Rotaviruses and parvovirus-like viruses cause gastroenteritis. The role of adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses and coronaviruses is not well-established. However, it is now recognized that these viruses can cause outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal disease. Enteric adenoviruses represent a separate serotype distinct from adenoviruses associated with acute respiratory infection and have been associated with acute diarrhoeal disease.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, a newly identified pathogen, causes severe pneumonia in humans, with a mortality of nearly 44%. Human-to-human spread has been demonstrated, raising the possibility that the infection could become pandemic [1] . A colorized electron micrograph shows the coronavirus MERS-CoV acute viral respiratory illness that is characterized primarily by cough, fever, and shortness of breath and is sometimes associated with severe and potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia and kidney failure. The illness was first observed in June 2012 in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, and soon afterward it was reported in other countries in the Middle East, including Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It later was detected in Europe, including cases in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom; in the North African country of Tunisia; and in countries more distant from the Middle East, including China, Malaysia, South Korea, and the United States. The largest MERS outbreak outside Saudi Arabia occurred in 2015, when an individual who had recently traveled to the Middle East subsequently fell ill in South Korea, transmitting the disease to close contacts. The dissemination of the disease by infected travelers leaving the Middle East suggested that MERS had the potential to escalate into an international public health emergency. The possibility of a pandemic was thought to be impeded, however, by the limited ability of the disease to be passed from one person to another. MERS is caused by a coronavirus known as MERS-CoV, which attacks the respiratory system. The recently defined receptor for MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is generally expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells and has been shown to be present on cultured human nonciliated bronchiolar epithelium cells, providing further information on the respiratory tropism of MERS-CoV [2] . Symptoms of illness appear anytime from 2 to 14 days following infection. Cough, fever, and shortness of breath are the primary symptoms, but others such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and myalgia (muscle pain) can also occur. In some persons, infection produces no symptoms or only mild cold-like symptoms, whereas in others, particularly in persons with underlying medical conditions, infection can produce severe illness [3] .

Though the impact of the Covid-19 health crisis has marked it as a rather unique milestone in the history disease outbreaks, the world, prior to this, was not a stranger with Coronavirus disease outbreaks (McIntosh 1974 , Myint 1994 , Cavanagh 2005 , Lim et al. 2016 , Chen et al. 2020 . Prior to 2020, two major outbreaks of this family of viruses had already been reported with at least one of them carrying the official label of a "global pandemic" ). On November 16, 2002, the first case of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) disease was reported in the Guangdong province in southern China, which by 2003, swiftly spread from continent to continent, prompting the World Health Organisation to declare it as a pandemic. In fact, SARS is known to be "the First Pandemic of the 21st Century" (Cherry and Krogstad 2004) . Nearly ten years later, on June 13, 2012, the first case of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) disease was discovered in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. These two constituted the two most major Coronavirus outbreaks until Covid-19 came along. Similar to Covid-19, though at a much smaller scale, each of these previous outbreaks generated a literature of their own (Kostoff and Morse 2011) .

Preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission by restricting mass gathering is an important objective of public health care system. COVID-19 is spread from person to person through direct contact. Thus, the spread of respiratory illnesses during the mass gathering is a major public health concerns with the potential of distribution of these infectious diseases. Based on earlier knowledge of MERS and SARS infections, the WHO in order to reduce the general risk of transmission of COVID-19 has recommended some precautionary measures such as avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory illness, regular hand washing with soap & water or hand sanitizer particularly after direct contact with sick people or their environment, maintaining cough etiquette, and avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals etc. Govt. of different countries postponed all types of religious, cultural, social, scientific, sport, and political mass gathering events in different parts of the world. Some international events such as Umrah, Hajj and the Olympic Games have already been suspended in order to avoid mass gathering. Media and information technology are providing significant support to the society for prevention and control of COVID-19 outbreak. So, restricting mass gathering could be the primary preventive strategy for COVID-19.

In this group of data, most pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed symptoms of infection before delivery. As little is known to the virus at the early stage of outbreak, most of the newborns were born by planned cesarean delivery to prevent transmission to newborns. Two newborns were separated from their mothers after birth and taken home by healthy family members at their request. 5 newborns were admitted to the NICU, of which 2 newborns developed mild respiratory distress after birth, and were given nCPAP-assisted ventilation.3 newborns had stable breathing and didn't require any respiratory support. All newborns were not treated with any antiviral drugs. The newborns that stayed in NICU had no abnormal signs during the monitoring of breathing, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. There was no abnormal manifestation in digestion, urination, defecation, and mental reactions during hospitalization. Complete blood counts taken on the first and third day of birth did not indicate obvious abnormal, all indicators were consistent with the normal range of newborns of the same gestational age and same day of age. Some newborns' MYO and CK-MB were higher than normal values. Coagulation indexes showed that some neonatal D-dimers were higher than normal values. Although Shek and colleagues have reported that SARS-CoV cannot be transmitted from infected mothers to newborns [11] , it can aggravate the clinical outcomes of mothers and newborns. Our observation demonstrated that the condition of infants was not aggravated after their exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and we have also commented that compared to infected adults, the condition of infected children is significantly milder, with faster recovery, shorter virus shedding time and better prognosis [7] . However, one newborn in our department who was born to mother with suspected COVID-19 presented hematochezia recently, so it is still necessary to accumulate more clinical data for further understanding of maternal infection's influence on the newborn.

The COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan ended in April, while the epidemics in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA, Canada) and the Italian Republic are continuing to grow. We fit the parameters of our network model to the confirmed cases in each of these regions. Although Wuhan, Toronto, and Italy differ in some ways, the way that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from one person to another is quite similar. Individuals may acquire infection from other infectious individuals, even if they do not contact each other directly. The Watts-Strogatz model supplies an ideal tool to study the spread of epidemics among individuals even if their locations are not considered. We used the Watts-Strogatz model to generate random networks with the small world properties appropriate for infectious disease transmission in these cities [16, 17] .
4316792	transmitted	camels	humans							11	11	13	13	15	15	Since its first outbreak in 2012 , the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases causing 851 deaths .	Fusion with, and subsequent entry into, the host cell is one of the critical steps in the life cycle of enveloped viruses. For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the spike protein (S) is the main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates the process of membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium ions (Ca2+) play an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by screening a mutant array in which E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP were substituted with neutrally charged alanines (A). Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested their ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells in modulating Ca2+ environments. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Subsequent electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry showed an approximate 1:1 MERS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, as opposed to an 1:2 SARS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, suggesting significant differences in FP Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity.SignificanceMERS-CoV is a major emerging infectious disease with zoonotic potential and a reservoir in dromedary camels and bats. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. In order to develop novel drugs and vaccines, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable the virus to infect host cells. Our data has found that calcium is an important regulator of viral fusion by interacting with negatively charged residues in the MERS-CoV FP region. This can guide therapeutic solutions to either block this calcium interaction and also repurpose already approved drugs for this use for a fast response to MERS-CoV outbreaks.

It is currently unclear how 2019-nCoV is spread, but it is suspected to be transmitted through contact with infected respiratory secretions, like other known coronaviruses. There are instances of sustained human-to-human transmission across generations of cases, especially near the epicenter in Wuhan City. 21 Current evidence suggests that close contact with an infected person is a major factor in disease transmission. CDC defines "close contact" 33 as being in or within two meters of an area with a confirmed patient or being directly exposed to infectious secretions without appropriate PPE. Healthcare facilities in China have reported spread from person to person. In addition, some mildly ill or potentially even asymptomatic patients may have a higher chance of spreading the disease to others as they may be less likely to seek medical care. 34 The possibility that patients may be infectious prior to symptom onset further compounds the difficulty of containing the virus and effectively preventing transmission.

The common human influenza virus (H3N2) is highly contagious but rarely lethal. Avian flu in chickens (H5N1) is a particularly virulent type that can kill rapidly and causes widespread organ damage. Fortunately, it is not easily transmitted from birds to humans, and more importantly, human to human spread is poor. However, swapping genetic material, should an individual be co-infected with both, might produce a hybrid H5 (avian flu) N2 (human flu) virus with devastating effects. DNA sequencing of the viral genome from various outbreaks has shown that the virus continues to mutate. This has implications for pathogenicity, as well as antiviral drug resistance, and having the right vaccine ready if needed. In this unpredictable environment, the value of rapid NAT diagnostics is crucial to detect early cases and for public health surveillance. The genes of the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic have been studied to better understand what makes an influenza virus virulent and capable of producing a pandemic [35] . (H1N1, 1918) : The virus from this pandemic, which killed about 40 million people, had not been isolated. Without a virus little research was possible, then the viral RNA sequence was determined using material from archival tissue, including formalin-fixed autopsy material. The sequence itself did not provide clues for why the Spanish influenza virus was so virulent, and so the next step was to reconstruct the viral coding segments and clone them into plasmids. Individual genes from the H1N1 1918 virus were then introduced into a common laboratory viral strain and pathogenicity sought. Although the H and N glycoproteins were factors in the virulence of this virus, it was also shown that one of the RNA polymerase subunits known as PB1 was involved. Another subunit (PB2) was then found to be important for viral transmissibility [35] . Swine influenza (H1N1, later called H1N1(09), 2009): After the appearance and then rapid disappearance of SARS (Box 6.4), followed by the concerns regarding the possibility of a H5N1 pandemic that did not occur (so far), This infection attracted a lot of publicity and provoked considerable fear when it emerged in China and then Hong Kong in 2003. SARS subsequently spread to many countries, producing around 700 deaths in the first half of 2003. This was at one time described as the first pandemic of the 21st century, but it never progressed beyond an epidemic because of effective public health measures effected by mid 2003 [36] . The social and economic impacts of this infection were considerable, including major disruptions to international travel. SARS was shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) which was thought to have crossed the species barrier, although the animal reservoir for SARS took a while to find. It is now thought to be:

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease provoked by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. The virus typically spreads from person to person via respiratory droplets produced during coughing, and common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath2. The COVID-19 outbreak was initially identified in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, and has since spread rapidly globally. It was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO)3. As of 26 March 2020, a total number of 480446 cumulative cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 175 countries and regions, including 22030 confirmed deaths, the majority of which have been reported in Italy (7503), Spain (4089) and China (3169)4. In Spain, as of 25 March 2020, most of those who have died were elderly, about 96% of deaths were in those over 60 years old, and 45% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease (31%)5.

The second global case of MERS was identified in a Qatari national who had previously travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2012. He was transferred from Qatar to a hospital in England where he clinically deteriorated and was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) however, unfortunately had a fatal outcome (Bermingham et al., 2012) . A second case in the UK was confirmed in February 2013, in a return traveler from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who was admitted with severe acute respiratory symptoms. This patient required ECMO treatment, however also unfortunately died. This case resulted in onward transmission to two further cases, of which one subsequently died (The Health Protection Agency UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation team C, 2013). In August 2018, a fifth case of MERS was diagnosed in a return traveler from the Middle East. The patient was initially admitted to a hospital in Leeds and then transferred to a specialist infectious disease unit in Liverpool. The patient had a positive outcome and there was no onward transmission of MERS-CoV to the close contacts As of the end of November 2019, MERS Co-V has infected 2,494 people with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37.1% (World Health Organization W, 2019; (WHO) WHO, 2019) and a notably higher CFR in ITU settings (Arabi et al., 2014) . Nosocomial outbreaks have occurred in Saudi Arabia and South Korea demonstrating the need for stringent infection control polices (Park et al., 2015) . In view of the high risk of imported cases, Public Health England (PHE) commissioned regional centers to perform MERS-CoV testing for possible MERS cases arriving in England. PHE Manchester laboratory is one of two centers that currently perform testing for MERS-CoV. It receives samples from the Greater Manchester region and surrounding counties of Lancashire, Merseyside, Cumbria and Cheshire. Additionally it receives samples from other areas of the North-West region of the United Kingdom which entails the counties of Yorkshire, Humber and also the counties of the North-East region.

Since clinical symptoms preceded the peak of transmission of this virus, outbreaks were restricted by quarantine measures in China, Canada, and other countries. Many epidemiologists predict similar types of outbreaks in the future with emerging viruses.

The lockdown response to the upsurge of COVID-19 cases in the UK in March 2020 brought an immediate end to my current research project's on-farm, in-depth social scientific fieldwork in the North of England. This research, funded by the Welcome Trust, 1 is itself focused on persistent, endemic infectious diseases-but in our case in cattle populations. As a team of social scientists, historians, and economic and epidemiological modellers, we explore the history of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) in the UK, examine how farmers, vets and other professionals attempt to deal with BVD in the present, and attempt to model infection patterns and how farmer behaviours affect the transmission and prevention of this disease. BVD can be transmitted between animals or passed from a cow to her calf in utero. Its effects vary in severity but it is linked to reduced productivity, various symptoms of ill-health, and increased susceptibility to other illnesses.

Likewise, 3L(0.765gsm) had efficiency of 85% which was higher than the same basis weight single-layer filter with 70% and the same p. This clearly pointed to the advantage of multilayering or multi-modules having higher efficiency of capturing 100nm aerosol due to reduced electrical interference between layers or modules and providing open pores by the support layers inter-dispersed between the nanofiber layers for reducing flow resistance. Fig. 11b , the filter with the uncharged 525-nm nanofiber configuration with multiple layers (1 to 4 layers) followed the iso-QF curve of 0.033Pa, implying that each filter layer can be treated as independent of the other filter layers. Incoming air passed from one filter layer to the next despite the filter layers were all packed compactly together. That is, the entrance and exit effect of fluid flow for a given filter layer was minimized. On the other hand, the charged multilayer filter followed somewhat the iso-QF curve, QF=0.14 -1 , for 2L, 3L, and 4L. However, there was a noticeable drop in QF at the 6L from the initial 0.14Pa -1 to a lower value of 0.11Pa -1 . Given the stack-up of multilayer did not quite follow exactly the iso-QF behaviour, the filter layers were not completely independent. The deviation from the iso-QE was not because of fluid flow effect between layers but due to the electrical interference of the different layers on each other and on the challenging aerosols. Despite this, the deviation only occurred for the 6 th layer and it was not substantial. For 4L (0.765gsm) filter with 525-nm fiber diameter with total basis weight of 3.06gsm, charged filter provided 90% capture while uncharged filter has only half of the efficiency! For 6L (0.765gsm) filter with higher basis weight of 4.59gsm, the efficiency for filtering the 100nm (Coronavirus size) reached 94% with pressure drop of 26Pa. The latter was within the 30Pa limit. For the case of using smaller basis weight of nanofibers in the filter, say up to a total of 0.77gsm of nanofibers, Fig. 11c showed the performance of charged and uncharged multilayer nanofiber filter using modules of 0.096gsm. The 8L (0.096gsm) charged filter achieved 90% whereas an 8L (0.096gsm) uncharged filter achieved only 50%! Interestingly, the uncharged multilayer followed closely the 0.033Pa -1 iso-QF curve while the charged multilayer followed the iso-QE curve of 0.135P -1 for 2L and 4L, but for 6L it started deviating from the original iso-QF curve; and QF for 8L dropped ultimately to 0.1Pa -1 (see Fig. 11c ).

As the GTase has not been identified for coronaviruses, we could not test whether the m7GTP can be transferred onto RNA substrate. In members of the alphavirus-like superfamily, the capping enzyme catalyzes GTP methylation and the following transfer of m7GMP from the newly formed m7GTP to RNA via a covalent [enzyme-m7GMP] intermediate (Ahola and Ahlquist, 1999) . Formation of m7GTP by SARS nsp14 raised the question whether m7GTP could subsequently provide its m7GMP moiety to form the covalent intermediate. To answer this question, we expressed and purified the major SARS-CoV nonstructural proteins and used radioactive [a-32 P]GTP for methylation and binding assays. The vaccinia virus capping enzyme D1-D12 was used as a positive control. The protein products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography (Fig. 4) . The results showed that D1-D12 could support the formation of the covalent [enzyme-GMP] intermediate, but neither m7GTP nor GTP could covalently bind with the SARS-CoV nonstructural proteins tested.

The tracking function processes the raw data provided by sensors and generates a set of tracks, representative of the real entities present in the scenario. A track typically carries the following information: a timestamp, position coordinates, velocity components, uncertainty on the kinematic components as expressed through the covariance matrix and additional attributes such as class/type and identity. In consideration of the potentially huge geographic extension of the system and of the importance to optimize the deployment of sensors as well as communication and processing power resources, a distributed tracking architecture is necessary. At the first level of the tracking architecture each sensor produces its own "local" tracks, in order to make available to the fusion engine a filtered information. Then a second level tracking combines local tracks originating from different sources into system tracks. This solution distributes the computational load on the peripheral nodes and reduces considerably the communication traffic which must be transmitted from the local level to the higher echelons; this is extremely important in consideration of the reduced bandwidth generally available between the peripheral elements and the center of the system.

In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused one of the most devastating epidemics known to the developed world. There were two important lessons from this epidemic. Firstly, coronaviruses, in addition to influenza viruses, can cause severe and rapidly spreading human infections. Secondly, bats can serve as the origin and natural animal reservoir of deadly human viruses. Since then, researchers around the world, especially those in Asia where SARS-CoV was first identified, have turned their focus to find novel coronaviruses infecting humans, bats, and other animals. Two human coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63, were identified shortly after the SARS-CoV epidemic as common causes of human respiratory tract infections. In 2012, a novel human coronavirus, now called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has emerged in the Middle East to cause fatal human infections in three continents. MERS-CoV human infection is similar to SARS-CoV in having a high fatality rate and the ability to spread from person to person which resulted in secondary cases among close contacts including healthcare workers without travel history to the Middle East. Both viruses also have close relationships with bat coronaviruses. New cases of MERS-CoV infection in humans continue to occur with the origins of the virus still unknown in many cases. A multifaceted approach is necessary to control this evolving MERS-CoV outbreak. Source identification requires detailed epidemiological studies of the infected patients and enhanced surveillance of MERS-CoV or similar coronaviruses in humans and animals. Early diagnosis of infected patients and appropriate infection control measures will limit the spread in hospitals, while social distancing strategies may be necessary to control the outbreak in communities if it remained uncontrolled as in the SARS epidemic.

Targeted RNA recombination was used to construct mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mutants containing chimeric nucleocapsid (N) protein genes in which segments of the bovine coronavirus N gene were substituted in place of their corresponding MHV sequences. This defined portions of the two N proteins that, despite evolutionary divergence, have remained functionally equivalent. These regions included most of the centrally located RNA-binding domain and two putative spacers that link the three domains of the N protein. By contrast, the amino terminus of N, the acidic carboxy-terminal domain, and a serine- and arginine-rich segment of the central domain could not be transferred from bovine coronavirus to MHV, presumably because these parts of the molecule participate in protein-protein interactions that are specific for each virus (or, possibly, each host). Our results demonstrate that targeted recombination can be used to make extensive substitutions in the coronavirus genome and can generate recombinants that could not otherwise be made between two viruses separated by a species barrier. The implications of these findings for N protein structure and function as well as for coronavirus RNA recombination are discussed.

Like the SARS and MERS virus, 2019-nCoV can spread from person to person. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main modes of transmission [2] , but current studies showed that aerosol transmission and the fecal oral route could not be ruled out. Because COVID-19 has an incubation period of up to 24 days, and even asymptomatic virus carriers can still spread the virus, it will take at least an estimated 2 to 3 months to control the epidemic. However, in China, there are still numerous patients with other diseases, especially trauma and cancer requiring surgical treatment. Therefore, in this special time, how to do operations safely and effectively deserves our attention.

We propose a tailored model for the epidemic spread of COVID-19. We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [18] [19] [20] 31] .To understand the geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.

In December 2019, a viral disease was transmitted in Wuhan, China. Many people showed symptoms of coughing, sneezing, and breathing difficulties, and dozens of people with pneumonia were treated and hospitalized in Wuhan [1] . While early announcements contended that the disease was not contagious and many popular gatherings were held as scheduled in early January, the disease was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus, and was confirmed later that it can spread from person to person. Early analyses estimated the reproduction number R0 of approximately 2.0, meaning that an infected person on average would spread the disease to two others, comparable to SARS and MERS [2] . Consequently, Wuhan city, a metropolitan area with 11 million people, was locked down with strict stay-at-home orders, and the shutdown quickly expanded to the entire province of Hubei [3] . The disease later caused the lockdown of many Chinese provinces in February. Eventually, China had to halt its economy for the entirety of February and most of March to contain the transmission [3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease COVID-19. Despite China's effective and decisive efforts in containing the outbreak since late January 2020 by locking down the most populous country and the second largest economy in the world, unfortunately, the disease quickly spread around the world [4] . Over twenty-seven thousand people lost their lives in Italy alone by April 28 (https://github.com/stccenter/COVID-19-Data/tree/master/Italy) and its healthcare system almost collapsed. Ventilators had to be moved from older people to save the lives of those younger ones [4] .

Following Pesaran (2004) , we estimated cross-sectional dependence. We rejected the null of no-cross-sectional dependence at a 5% level of significance. We also rejected the null of slope homogeneity at a 5% level of significance using the delta tilde and adjusted delta tilde estimates. We estimated the system GMM to account for cross-sectional dependence among heterogeneous observations. The one-period lag value of attributable COVID-19 deaths is positive and statistically significant at 1%, implying its percentage increase will result in 0.0123 percentage increase in COVID-19 attributable deaths. The intuition point to the relatively less COVID-19 attributable deaths as induced by previously confirmed cases. Although the lagged factors control for simultaneity bias, we cannot completely rule out the devastating influence of historical information leading to COVID-19 deaths. Types of shared residents, proximity to health care facilities, choice of healthcare utilisation in the time of illness and most importantly during this global pandemic, existing health conditions, as well as the devastating influence of COVID-19 attributable deaths to friends and family in terms of depression, frontline health workers who are saddled with the care and post-death management of patients, are magnanimous in this global pandemic era. In other climes, the number of confirmed cases is positive and statistically significant at 5%, implying 0.0453 percentage increase in COVID-19 attributable deaths in Africa. By way of intuition, a proportionate rise in confirmed cases is attributable to potential deaths by~0.045. Principally, the cluster of residents and sub-group around regions with high confirmed cases should be dispersed to reduce the wave at which the virus transmits from human to human.

Coronavirus, which can cause respiratory syndrome, to date has affected over seventeen thousand individuals, especially in China. Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (MCs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. Viral activate MCs release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provokes the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-33. Here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family members.

We observed a significant seven-day cycle in (i) reported COVID-19 new casesa (in 7/12 countries), and in (ii) reported COVID-19 deathsb (in 7/12 countries), based on data from the 12 developed North-American and European countries that reported more than 1,000 deaths by April 28th (Spaina, Italya and Switzerlanda, Belgiumb, Canadab and the USAb, Germanya,b, the Netherlandsa,b, Swedena,b and the UKa,b). Daily reported numbers (March 29th to April 28th) are based on Our World in Data database (derived from the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention, ECDC). In all seven countries, numbers of new cases peaked on Thursday-Friday, five days after the weekend, corresponding with a reported ~5-day lag between contact with an infected person and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. Death tolls peaked on Wednesday-Thursday in all seven countries, ~12-14 days following a weekend, corresponding with the reported median of 14-day hospitalization before death. One may suspect that the weekend restricts the availability of testing or reporting of new cases, that are eventually reported during the following week. However, to completely account for both observations, this artifact should occur uniformly in all the above-mentioned countries and consistently along the entire month studied. Moreover, deaths are defined events and seems less likely to be recorded or reported inaccurately, at least for the vast majority of cases. Thus, we hypothesize that an increase in inter-generational social interactions occurs during the weekend, which facilitates transfer of COVID-19 from younger people to older vulnerable individuals. These and additional infected older people account for most recognized COVID-19 cases and deaths, which may occur at regular time intervals, specifically in this vulnerable population. Additional explanations may include weekly rhythms in immune functions, hospital care quality, or other various health-related behaviors. Our hypotheses should be re-tested and refined based on databases that accurately report events times when these will become available.

COVID-19 has a capacity for human-to-human transmission, the public has no hard immunity against it, a high mortality rate, which makes it suitable agents for pandemic potential and the modern transport system also helps in its rapid expansion. Easy mode of transmission, nature of the virus, population density, environmental condition, social culture (like handshaking, etc.) are major contributors to its rapid spreading. Therefore, COVID-19 turned into a global health concern since its inception from Wuhan, China. Like other respiratory viruses, coronavirus is also contagious and easily spread from one person to another. Many viruses produced similar clinical symptoms; therefore COVID-19 cannot be differentiating on the basis of their clinical symptoms, for its accurate diagnosis a sensitive and specific assay always required. Unfortunately, only a few countries have a capacity for proper viral diagnosis or surveillance by laboratory assays. Without laboratoryconfirmed assay or under the capacity of viral diagnosis or surveillance system can decreases the authenticity and accuracy of data. The Basic Reproductive Number (R 0 ) can be utilized to calculate averaging the number of infections produced by infected individuals in susceptible populations. Basic Reproductive Number (R 0 ) is for the SARS-CoV (1.4-5.5), MERS-CoV (\ 1), COVID-19 (2.2-2.6) and Influenza viruses . The members of the coronaviridae are less contagious than influenza viruses [24, 27] . Although, COVID-19 is a slow virus than influenza viruses, but even then spread in the 210 countries within 120 days and caused a large number of infections. In these hundred days, COVID-19 causes the 15, 21, 966 laboratories confirmed cases and 88, 659 (5.82%) deaths worldwide till 09 April 2020. The USA (4, 35, 160), Spain (1, 48, 220), Italy (1, 39, 422), Germany (1, 13, 296) and France (1, 12, 950) are top five infected countries have 9, 49, 048 (62.35%) of total laboratories confirmed cases of COVID-19.

COVID-19 infection is a rapidly developing field, and we should expect more infected dialysis patients' case reports and analyses. In a recent research letter by Arentz et al. [8] , clinical characteristics of 21 patients including 2 long-term dialysis admitted to an ICU in Washington State were described. A unique feature of our reported case is the potentially long incubation period, assuming this patient contracted the infection in South Korea in early January 2020, which was 6 weeks prior to the first presentation, but we cannot be certain. Alternatively he could be one of the first community spread cases identified in southern California. The delayed diagnosis for the first 5 days was likely because it was not recognized by the treating centers that gastrointestinal manifestation may be a part of COVID-19 infection. Our reported dialysis-dependent patient is notably healthier and younger than the average dialysis patients in the United States and without diabetes but with a history of hypertension and cardiac disease. Yet, he developed ARDS and has required ventilatory support. This case report highlights the importance of considering COVID-19 infection in a variety of clinical presentation that may not initially include typical respiratory symptom to prevent ongoing exposure of potentially affected individuals to the general population. It also highlights the need for rapidly available testing for all patients who present to healthcare setting with even nonsevere and atypical symptoms. This patient with community spread disease traveled from Southern California to Utah for 2 days using public airports, commercial flights, and public transportation, potential exposures which could have been avoided if testing supplies and public health recommendations would have been different. The consequences of this exposure remain unclear, but the United States has since had a rapidly increasing number of cases.

COVID-19 has the potential to cause severe acute respiratory tract infection among infected humans and is commonly transmitted from person to person via hands, saliva, nasal droplets, and surface contacts [3, 6] . The average incubation period ranges of COVID-19 from 4 to 14 days [7] . The infected person usually presents with upper respiratory tract infection (RTI) and complaints of high-grade fever, a dry cough, and dyspnea [8] . It is highly recommended to keep any suspected individuals in quarantine (isolation) and under observation until further investigation by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can take place [9] . Unfortunately, there is no antiviral vaccine available on the market, but on 16th March 2020 the first clinical trial was initiated by the National Health Institute (NHI), USA [3] . Therefore, patients have to rely on supportive therapy such as vitamins A, C and D; chloroquine phosphate; and general healthcare until the body's immune system can eradicate the infection [10] .

The feline coronaviruses can be divided into two distinct antigenic groups on the basis of antigenic differences found on the peplomer (E2) glycoprotein of the virus. Because the E2 glycoprotein is responsible for many of the biological functions of coronaviruses, experiments were done to determine whether there were any E2 functional differences between these two antigenic groups. The avirulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) isolate FIPV-UCD-2, which has one antigenic type of E2, was less rapidly internalized and could not spread from cell to cell in the presence of neutralizing antibody. Two virulent isolates, FIPV-DF2 and FIPV-79-1146, as well as the non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) isolate FECV-79-1683, all of which have the second antigenic type of E2, were very rapidly internalized and were able to spread from cell to cell despite the presence of neutralizing antibody. The avirulent FIPV-UCD-2 and FECV-79-1683 isolates were more labile at 37 degrees C at pHs of 6.5 and above than were the virulent FIPV-DF2 and FIPV-79-1146 isolates.

Abstract A novel bat-origin coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and continues to spread across China and the world. At the time of writing, a massive global response has been implemented to control the disease as it spreads from person to person. Yet the high-risk human-wildlife interactions and interfaces that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and of 2019-nCoV continue to exist in emerging disease hotspots globally. To prevent the next epidemic and pandemic related to these interfaces, we call for research and investment in three areas: 1) surveillance among wildlife to identify the high-risk pathogens they carry; 2) surveillance among people who have contact with wildlife to identify early spillover events; and 3) improvement of market biosecurity regarding the wildlife trade. As the emergence of a novel virus anywhere can impact the furthest reaches of our connected world, international collaboration among scientists is essential to address these risks and prevent the next pandemic.

The COVID-19 RNA virus carries a high mutation rate and ability to transfer from person to person as compared to other coronaviruses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), till 23rd February 2020, the COVID-19 affected a total of 78,811 individuals across globally of which, 77,042 were reported in China while 1769 were reported in other countries. The death toll in China is 2445 and 17 deaths have been reported in the rest of the world. According to the reports till 2nd January 2020, 41 patients have been admitted to the hospital of which most of the patients were men and 66% of them had exposure to the Huanan seafood market and the median age of patients was 49 years [2] . The health-care workers are also diagnosed with the infection including those working in similar wards [6] . The time taken by COVID-19 to infect other individuals is similar to that of SARS. It is estimated that on average each infected person infects 2-3 persons and this occurrence increases two-folds, every 6.4 days [7] . It was observed that people with mild infection are more actively spread the infection [8] . Due to critical nature of the outbreak, the virus was sequenced on urgent basis and the first sequence was available on 10 th January, 2020 online at virological.org. It was noted that COVID-19 has much resemblance to SARS-CoV at the genomic level [4] . Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and dyspnea, sore throat and leukopenia. To date no vaccine COVID-19 is available and is need of an hour to develop a vaccine to prevent further spread of the disease. To this end, immuno-informatics can be applied to a complete protein data set of the virus for deep antigen analysis and thus can save time and cost for designing a vaccine against COVID-19. This will ease the early development of a vaccine and proposed design can be subjected immediately to experimental trials.

Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1,700 bedside clinicians have been infected. A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9. For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.

December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, which can spread from person to person. 1 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries during the 2012 MERS outbreak. 7, 8 Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds. Previous studies revealed that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic in origin, originally coming from bats, [9] [10] [11] [12] with SARS-CoV spreading from bats to palm civets to humans, [13] [14] [15] and MERS-CoV spreading from bats to camels to humans. 16, 17 Recent research has also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely originated in bats, a proposal based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses. 18 However, like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have been transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal host. 19 Therefore, the identity of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 remains a key and urgent question. Furthermore, to stem future outbreaks of this type and preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research priority.

SARS-CoV-2 REPLICATION, ACCUMULATION, AND BRAIN ENTRANCE Another suitable source of biological samples for early SARS-CoV-2 detection is the olfactory epithelium (OE), which is easily accessible within the nasal cavity ( Figure 1 ). Recent reports indicate that total anosmia or partial loss of the sense of smell are early markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This phenomenon may be caused by different and yet unidentified factors, e.g., "cytokine storm" initiated in some patients or direct damage of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) located in the olfactory epithelium ( Figure 2 ). The latter possibility is particularly likely due to the fact that cells located in the OE express both protein receptors required for effiecient SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Several data sets deposited in gene expression databases show relatively high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human and murine olfactory mucosa (Table 1 ). In mammals, OE is a continuously regenerating multilayer structure containing both neuronal and non-neuronal cells ( Figure 2 ). The key question is whether ACE2 and TRMPSS2 expression in the OE is neuronal or non-neuronal or whether it occurs in both cell types. Neuronal expression of host receptors will likely facilitate SARS-CoV-2 brain infection through the uptake into ciliated dendrites/soma and subsequent anterograde axonal transport along the olfactory nerve. Non-neuronal expression of ACE2/TRMPSS2 may possibly establish nasal cavity OE as a virus reservoir. Three major RNaseq transcriptome studies conducted in human and murine OE consistently suggest non-neuronal expression of ACE2. 4−6 Hence, ACE2 expression is not clearly detected in mature ORNs, which are the only OE neurons connected to the brain. Expression of TMPRS2 seems to be higher compared to that of ACE2 and takes place likely in both neuronal and non-neuronal OE cells. 5, 6 One state-of-the-art RNaseq study showed intriguingly mosaic TMPRSS2 expression which occurs only in subpopulation of mature ORNs, even though the majority of other genes were more evenly expressed in these neurons. 6 It suggests that some olfactory neurons in the OE may be more vulnerable for viral infection than other morphologically similar ORNs. Moreover, expression of murine ACE2 and TMPRSS2 evaluated by microarrays has a tendency to increase with age ( Table 2 ). If it is true in humans, then in elderly people the OE may be more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 accumulation. However, it should be remembered that although ACE2 is a mandatory factor for viral entry into the cell, TMPRSS2 can probably be replaced by other proteases from this family such as TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11A, 11D, and 11E1. Of these proteases, only TMPRSS4 is also present in the OE, likely in immature neurons and in non-neuronal cells. 5, 6 It is known from a previous SARS-CoV pandemic that, that even though lungs were the major site of infection, the brain was also involved in some patients. In addition, it was shown in transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 that SARS-CoV infected the brain through ORNs. 7 Genetically modified mice express only human ACE2 and not human TMPRSS2. This may additionally suggest that murine ORNs express endogenous TMPRSS2, because both proteins are required for efficient infection. Intriguingly, there was an approximately 60 h delay from the time of nasal infection until SAR-CoV virus detection in the olfactory bulb. During that time the virus likely replicated and accumulated in different OE cells, because its subsequent transport to further parts of the brain required a relatively short time of an additional 12−20 h. 7 The results from transgenic hACE2 mice indicate that SARS-CoV probably uses transneuronal/transsynaptic routes employing axonal transport in the brain and this can also be true for SARS-CoV-2. It is known for other viruses, e.g., rabies virus, that they can hijack existing vesicular axonal transport machineries to spread within the brain. There is very recent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 enters early and late endosomal compartments in non-neuronal cells; thus, it may possibly be directed to the vesicular axonal pathway in neurons. 1 However, it should be remembered that the hACE2 mouse is an overexpressor model with expression of human ACE2 controlled by human keratin K18 promoter. For this reason, alternative and more physiological knock-in models for SARS-CoV-2 studies in the nervous system would be desirable. Alternatively to the olfactory axonal route, SARS-CoV-2 may pass from non-neuronal OE cells directly to cerebrospinal fluid surrounding olfactory nerve bundles, located near the cribriform plate. Once in cerebrospinal fluid, the virus could reach most of the brain areas including medulla oblongata where cardiorespiratory controlling nuclei are located. 8 Brain infection in COVID-19 patients is currently being seriously considered because of many reports of neurological impairments such as stroke, epilepsy ,and encephalitis. The ACE2 expression in glia and in neurons in the brain is low but also well documented. But the specific sites where SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain are not clearly identified. 8 Mature olfactory neurons present in the OE are probably one such place. However, SARS-CoV-2 virus must first invade high ACE2expressing yet unidentified non-neuronal OE cells and then pass to low-ACE2-expressing mature ORNs to be finally transported along olfactory axons to the brain. A good candidate for such cells is specialized glia known as olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs). OECs were previously shown to enhance human herpesvirus-6 replication and accumulation in the OE before virus infected the brain. 9 Many studies have already shown that this type of glia cells can supply axons with macromolecules by way of exosomes and this could be a mechanism of ACE2-independent virus transfer from OEC to ORN axons.

Abstract Background COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that has spread from person to person throughout the world. Geographical disease surveillance is a powerful tool to monitor the spread of epidemics and pandemic, providing important information on the location of new hot-spots, assisting public health agencies to implement targeted approaches to minimize mortality. Methods County level data from January 22-April 28 was downloaded from USAfacts.org to create heat maps with ArcMapTM for diagnosed COVID-19 cases and mortality. The data was analyzed using spatial and space-time scan statistics and the SaTScanTM software, to detect geographical cluster with high incidence and mortality, adjusting for multiple testing. Analyses were adjusted for age. While the spatial clusters represent counties with unusually high counts of COVID-19 when averaged over the time period January 22-April 20, the space-time clusters allow us to identify groups of counties in which there exists a significant change over time. Results There were several statistically significant COVID-19 clusters for both incidence and mortality. Top clusters with high rates included the areas in and around New York City, New Orleans and Chicago, but there were also several small rural clusters. Top clusters for a recent surge in incidence and mortality included large parts of the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic Region, and several smaller areas in and around New York and New England. Conclusions Spatial and space-time surveillance of COVID-19 can be useful for public health departments in their efforts to minimize mortality from the disease. It can also be applied to smaller regions with more granular data. Keywords: Clusters, prospective space-time analysis, spatial analysis, COVID-19.

However, its apparent size and global effects were underestimated at the beginning. It is sound to mention the scope of previous epidemics to differentiate COVID-19. SARS-COV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) had started in China and affected Taiwan, Singapore, USA and Canada. During its influential period, around 8,000 cases were reported and more than 900 people had died with an 11% fatality rate [36] . Avian influenza-H5N1 that spread from poultry to human resulted in 400 deaths as of 2008 [30] . The most recent epidemic of MERS-COV (Middle East respiratory syndrome) mostly affected the Middle East in 2012 with more than 400 deaths. The only out of region case was South Korea, where 150 deaths were reported in 2015. What makes COVID-19 more devastating is its speed of contagion mostly in Europe and the Americas, although it started in the East Asia. By the end of April, number of reported cases and deaths were more than 3 million and 200.000 consecutively around the world [3] . With its 7% fatality rate, this global disease was announced as a pandemic by the WHO on 11th of March 2020.

Measles is an exclusively human pathogen which could be eradicated through sufficient vaccination coverage. With secondary attack rates of 75-90% among susceptible subjects [65] , measles outbreaks occur whenever the population's overall immunity is less than 95% [71, 72] , be it nationwide or in small "pockets". The re-emergence of major measles outbreaks in countries in which it had previously been well "controlled" or eliminated (Fig. 1 ) is the most dramatic example of the deleterious impact of vaccine hesitancy on community protection [73] : a substantial proportion of cases reported in the US were intentionally unvaccinated [74] . A mathematical simulation estimated that even a 5% decline in measles vaccine coverage in the US would have substantial public health and economic consequences [75] . Therefore, "every shot matters". Unfortunately, a dramatic increase in measles cases has been reported in the US in 2019, the largest since 1994 and after measles was declared eliminated in 2000 [73] . Although global measles deaths have decreased by 80% from 2000 to 2017 in LMICs following accelerated immunization activities [39] , vaccine hesitancy readily spreads from HIC to LMICs.

Similar to other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV enters target cells by inducing fusion between the viral and cellular membranes, a process mediated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein (Spaan et al., 1988; De Groot et al., 1989; Bos et al., 1995; Luo and Weiss, 1998; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Simmons et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004a) . The spike protein is a type-1 transmembrane protein. The spike protein is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor which for several CoV members is cleaved by a cellular endo-protease to generate two non-covalently bound subunits S1 and S2 (Frana et al., 1985; Sturman et al., 1985) . In the case of the SARS-CoV S protein, it is believed that the S polypeptide chain is not cleaved upon release from infected cells but is cleaved during virus entry (Follis et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2005) . The S1 subunit of the spike protein forms a globular head and is responsible for recognition of the host cell receptor(s) (Taguchi, 1995) , which for the SARS-CoV has been identiWed as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD209L JeVers et al., 2004) . The S2 subunit constitutes the stalk-like region of the spike and functions in membrane fusion. The sequence of the S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide sequence, two characteristic 4-3 hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions (denoted HRN and HRC herein), a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. These regions are responsible for membrane anchoring, oligomerization of the S protein into a trimeric state and fusion between viral and cellular membranes (Luo et al., 1999; Bosch et al., 2003 Bosch et al., , 2004 Ingallinella et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004; Guillen et al., 2005) . In the current model describing S protein function, S is thought to drive membrane fusion by coupling irreversible protein refolding with membrane juxtaposition. After binding to the host cell receptor, a conformational change is transmitted from S1 to S2 which causes the fusion peptide (a region of »20 hydrophobic residues located N-terminal to the Wrst heptad repeat region, HRN in S2) to be released from the interior of the molecule and inserted into the target cell bilayer (Hernandez et al., 1997; Damico et al., 1998) . This "metastable" fusion intermediate state is then followed by a fur-ther conformational change to a new low energy postfusion state. Conversion to the post-fusion state involves a collapse of the two heptad repeat regions such that they now form a six-helix bundle, where three HRN helices fold into a central parallel triple stranded -helical coiled-coil, and wrapped on the outside of this core is an outer layer of three anti-parallel HRC strands (Epand, 2003; Bosch et al., 2004; Ingallinella et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004) . This post-fusion conformation displays the trimer of hairpins organization characteristically seen for other class I viral fusion protein domains such as HIV-1 gp41, inXuenza virus HA, and Ebola virus gp21 proteins (Bullough et al., 1994; Chan et al., 1997; Weissenhorn et al., 1997 Weissenhorn et al., , 1998 Chen et al., 1999; Malashkevich et al., 1999) . The structures of the S2 ectodomain in the six-helix conformation for both SARS-CoV and murine coronavirus MHV (a related CoV strain) have recently been reported Supekar et al., 2004; . The refolding of the HR regions into the six-helix bundle structure places the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain in close proximity, thereby facilitating membrane pore formation and delivery of the nucleocapsid into the cell (Eckert and Kim, 2001; Epand, 2003) .

Epigenetics can be referred to as heritable changes of gene expression that are not caused by alterations in the primary nucleotide gene sequence (Wise and Charchar 2016) . Epigenetic modifications are biochemical changes of the chromatin, in other words, DNA or histones, that are functionally relevant, but do not affect the nucleotide sequence of the genome (Potaczek et al. 2017) . Generally, epigenetic modifications largely depend on general concept of what many scientists called writers, erasers and readers with their variability influencing the transition between heterochromatin and euchromatin. DNA methylation is one of the first identified and, at the same time, one of the most widely studied epigenetic modifications in humans. It occurs by covalent methylation of a cytosine within the CpG dinucleotides. Methylation at the fifth position of cytosine (5 mC) in DNA is a wellestablished epigenetic mark. It is distributed across the genome generally at CpG dinucleotides, which can occur in clusters known as CpG islands (Alashkar et al. 2019) . The major role of DNA methylation in mammals is to repress gene expression by recruiting different silencing protein complexes, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), which in turn can block the transcription machinery (Alashkar et al. 2019) . Histone acetylation status is regulated by two groups of enzymes exerting opposite effects, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HATs catalyze the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to an amino acid group of the target lysine residues in the histone tails, which makes chromatin less compact and aids accessibility to the transcriptional machinery (Alhamwe et al. 2018 ). It has been proposed that the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression facilitated by miRNAs plays an important role in the fine-tuning of transcriptional programs in the context of bigger regulatory networks and in buffering fluctuations in gene expression resulting from random internal cellular modulation and/or environmental influences (Potaczek et al. 2017 ). Presently, no study has been done on the epigenetics of Type II interferon gamma in respect to rabies virus infection in mice brain. Consequently, this study investigated the epigenetic modifications associated with IFNG in Challenge virus standard (CVS) strain and Nigerian street rabies virus (SRV) infected mice. Our findings suggest that epigenetic modification via DNA methylation and histone acetylation may have played a role in the expression of type II interferon gamma in Rabies Virus infection.

The origins of more than 75% of coronavirus infections are considered zoonotic, i.e., animals are the main source of the outbreaks. For example, SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Bats are currently considered a reservoir for all human coronaviruses, as mentioned above [5, 71] . Many coronaviruses are circulating in animals but have not yet infected humans. The type of animal that SARS-CoV-2 originated from is still unclear. At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, many patients were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. After retrospectively studying case reports, the number of patients that did not have exposure to animal markets has risen, indicating person-to-person spread was also occurring at that time [66] . SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to bat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV [8] . A group of researchers reported early in the outbreak that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has the highest similarity of codon usage bias with snakes [72, 73] ; however, this method to determine initial host origins is dubious. Interestingly, researchers also reported one amino acid difference in the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of Pangolin-CoV compared to that of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins might play a role as an intermediate host (Xiao et al., data currently under review). Another group of researchers reported that the virus originated from bats based on the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, which is 96% identical to bat coronavirus RaTG13. There were speculations that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory-engineered CoV and leaked directly from a laboratory in Wuhan where a bat CoV (RaTG13) was recently reported. However, there is no evidence to support this allegation [74] . Recently, a group of researchers found that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks but efficiently in ferrets and cats [75] . Scientists are still trying to find the main source of the disease outbreak and identify the definitive intermediate hosts.

Both established (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and novel (SARS-CoV-2) coronaviruses were reported to spread from an infected person to a non-infected person through direct or indirect contact. SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported to be transmitted directly from person to person like most respiratory viruses via close contact with an infected person or through respiratory droplets (aerosol) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can be inhaled to reach the lung. The virus can be indirectly transmitted via touching a surface or an object that was previously contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, eyes, or mouth [76] and possibly via the fecal-oral route [77, 78] . Asymptomatic carriers (during the incubation period of the virus) and patients after recovery from the acute form of the disease are also considered a potential source of virus transmission to healthy persons [10, 12] . Interestingly, human coronaviruses are able to survive on steel, metal, wood, aluminum, paper, glass, plastic, ceramic, disposable gowns, and surgical gloves for 2-9 days. High temperature (≥30 °C) can reduce the persistence period, while low temperature (4 °C) increases the persistence time up to 28 days [79] . Transmission of the virus vertically from mother to fetus or via breast milk has not been confirmed yet [80] . The transmission cycle of coronavirus among animals and humans is shown in Figure 3 .

These findings suggest that a human respiratory pathogen which may directly infect and be latent in the human CNS might involve in severe and irreversible nervous and respiratory system pathologies.

It is believed that a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was passed from palm civets to humans and caused the epidemic of SARS in 2002 to 2003. The major species barriers between humans and civets for SARS-CoV infections are the specific interactions between a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a viral spike protein and its host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In this study a chimeric ACE2 bearing the critical N-terminal helix from civet and the remaining peptidase domain from human was constructed, and it was shown that this construct has the same receptor activity as civet ACE2. In addition, crystal structures of the chimeric ACE2 complexed with RBDs from various human and civet SARS-CoV strains were determined. These structures, combined with a previously determined structure of human ACE2 complexed with the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, have revealed a structural basis for understanding the major species barriers between humans and civets for SARS-CoV infections. They show that the major species barriers are determined by interactions between four ACE2 residues (residues 31, 35, 38, and 353) and two RBD residues (residues 479 and 487), that early civet SARS-CoV isolates were prevented from infecting human cells due to imbalanced salt bridges at the hydrophobic virus/receptor interface, and that SARS-CoV has evolved to gain sustained infectivity for human cells by eliminating unfavorable free charges at the interface through stepwise mutations at positions 479 and 487. These results enhance our understanding of host adaptations and cross-species infections of SARS-CoV and other emerging animal viruses.

The coronavirus implicated in SARS (SARS associated coronavirus) has got only 50-60% homology in nucleotide component to the known human coronaviruses. 2 As expected with a point source epidemic, several nucleotide sequences of the viruses isolated from patients from different regions are identical. ~3 The apparent lack of antibody in all serum specimens except for those from patients with SAILS suggests that this virus has not circulated previously. Presumably, this virus originated in animals and mutated or recombined in a fashion that permitted it to infect, cause disease and pass on from person to person. 2 The name suggested for this new coronavirus is urbani SARS associated coronavirus in memory of Dr Carlo Urbani, the 40 year old WHO physician and infectious disease specialist whose work defined SARS, who died on March 29 of SARS. 2 Metapneumovirus was isolated in 5 patients in one study, s but further studies did not reveal the same.

On March 23, 2003, a 74-year-old immunocompromised man was transferred to our ICU from a hospital where the original cluster of Toronto's SARS cases occurred (2) . The patient originally had signs and symptoms consistent with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Before transfer, SARS was excluded from the differential diagnosis because the patient had not traveled, had never left the emergency department of the referring hospital, and had only had a single recent outpatient visit to an area of the original hospital in which SARS had not been identified. Upon arrival in our ICU, the patient was placed in precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pending admission screening results (6) . Therapy with broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs was initiated. Humidified high-flow oxygen was administered for the first 5 h, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation by oronasal mask for the next 18.25 h, and invasive mechanical ventilation for the subsequent time (7.5 h). Endotracheal intubation required fiber-optic placement. That the extent of the outbreak at the referring institution was larger than originally appreciated became apparent at this time; therefore, the patient was transferred to another facility for placement in negative pressure isolation for possible exposure to SARS. Subsequently, his family members became ill, and the SARS-associated coronavirus was identified in the patient's respiratory secretions (polymerase chain reaction testing of bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the diagnosis of SARS).

To successfully mitigate the extraordinary devastation caused by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is crucial to identify important risk factors for this disease. One such neglected health determinant is the sex of the patient. This is an essential clinical characteristic, as it can factor into a patient's clinical management and preventative measures. Some clinical studies have shown disparities in the proportion between males and females that have more severe clinical outcomes or, subsequently, die from this disease. However, this association has not been unequivocally established. Thus, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the association between male sex and COVID-19 severity. We systematically reviewed the literature, identified non-randomized studies that matched predetermined selection criteria, and performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the proportion of males among four disease severity categories. Appropriate assessment strategies were implemented to assess and minimize potential biases. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that males constituted a significantly higher proportion of those who had adverse clinical outcomes and died from COVID-19. As the coronavirus spread from the East to the West, male sex remained a consistent risk factor. Our results support the establishment of the male sex as an important risk factor for this disease. Early identification and appropriate medical care for males with lab-confirmed COVID-19 may substantially change the course of clinical prognosis, resulting in greater numbers of lives saved.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belongs to beta group of coronavirus and was first discovered in 2012. MERS-CoV can infect multiple host species and cause severe diseases in human. We conducted a series of phylogenetic and bioinformatic analyses to study the evolution dynamics of MERS-CoV among different host species with genomic data. Our analyses show: 1) 28 potential recombinant sequences were detected and they can be classified into seven potential recombinant types; 2) The spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV was under strong positive selection when MERS-CoV transmitted from their natural host to human; 3) Six out of nine positive selection sites detected in spike (S) protein are located in its receptor-binding domain which is in direct contact with host cells; 4) MERS-CoV frequently transmitted back and forth between human and camel after it had acquired the human-camel infection capability. Together, these results suggest that potential recombination events might have happened frequently during MERS-CoV’s evolutionary history and the positive selection sites in MERS-CoV’s S protein might enable it to infect human.

Corona virus is one of the common viruses which can cause multiple diseases in humans as well as animals. In 2015, its outbreak in South Korea has caused more than ten deaths, and thousands of citizens got infected [2] . MERS-CoV infected person is having primary symptoms such as respiratory diseases with fever, cough, shortness of breath (SoB), and diarrhea. Some of the secondary symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are acute renal failure, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and consumptive coagulopathy [3] . The MERS-CoV source is not yet confirmed; however, many studies suggested that this is an animal virus. Reports have confirmed the transmission of the virus from human to human, but proper intermediate hosts for its transmission are still unknown which further increases its risk [4] . MERS-CoV is a novel corona virus that was first identified in the residents of Middle East countries in late 2012 with a death rate of more than fifty percent in infected citizens. As the studies suggested, MERS-CoV spreads using common mode of contacts from one individual to another [3] . MERS-CoV is declared as a public health threat; therefore, the government's healthcare agencies are committed to provide affordable medical facilities and suggestions to the infected citizens. One of the most important steps to cure MERS-CoV is to stop its infection rate and transmission process by early identification of infected patients as well as providing precautionary measures to uninfected citizens. Identified infected patients should be quarantined as early as possible so that they do not contribute further in the infection spreading. The healthcare sector and the government agencies are adopting cloud computing with data mining approaches to control different infectious diseases [5] . Cloud computing can offer benefits such as improvement in quality of medical services, increased risk responsiveness, collaborating mobile apps, large storage space, and reduced capital investment.

The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the way we practice nuclear medicine [1] . The virus can spread from person to person very quickly through respiratory droplets, which is the major reason causing the global pandemic. Thus, it is very important for nuclear medicine service to take prudent measures when dealing with aerosol-generating procedures, such as request for ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE). The patients referred to nuclear medicine service for PE diagnosis usually had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and elevated D-dimer levels, which were commonly seen in both PE and COVID-19 infection [2] . Meanwhile, there are increased evidence of association of PE in patients with COVID-19 infection, and failure to diagnose PE will worsen the prognosis [3, 4] .

Not soon after the release of the 2019-nCoV genome, a scientist released a full genome of a coronavirus, Bat-CoV-RaTG13, from bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), which is colonized in Yunan province, nearly 2,000 km away from Wuhan. Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 96% identical at the whole genome level to the 2019-nCoV, suggesting the 2019-nCoV, could be of bat origin [10] . However, with rare direct contacts between such bats and humans, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it seems to be more likely that the spillover of 2019-nCoV to humans from another intermediate host rather than directly from bats.

Viruses are the most common cause of respiratory infection [5] . Influenza viruses are important human respiratory pathogens that cause seasonal upper respiratory tract infections in the community, endemic infections, and periodic, unpredictable pandemics [5, 6] . Influenza viruses are single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza type A is the most important of all respiratory viruses in terms of morbidity and mortality in the general population. Influenza A virus is transmitted from person to person through aerosolized or respiratory droplets. In the USA, more than 35,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations due to influenza occur annually, and the number continues to increase [6] . Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The 2002-2003 pandemic of SARS and the ongoing emergence of MERS have demonstrated that CoVs posed significant threats to public health [7, 8] . A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans [2, 9, 10] . The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a wide concern worldwide. The clinical manifestations of viral pneumonia are diverse and overlap [6] . The clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue are found in both influenza pneumonia and COVID-19. It is difficult to predict etiology based on clinical manifestations. Patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed positive detection of COVID-19 in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract of patients were admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center for further treatment [7, 11] . False-negative COVID-19 cases were reported in recent investigations [12, 13] . In our center, RT-PCR was performed the first three times in one case of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19, revealing a negative detection of COVID-19. Another case who did not have epidemic exposure accompanied by dry cough was finally confirmed as COVID-19. However, CT images of the two cases showed lung lesions. Additionally, the chest CT findings of viral pneumonia were non-specific and difficult to differentiate from those of other infections [6] . However, a similar pathogenesis of pneumonia caused by the same viral family often shows similar imaging characteristics. Although not all cases manifest with typical patterns, most typical imaging patterns of viral pneumonia can be classified according to viral families [5, 6] . Recent studies have demonstrated that CT can play a critical role in the early identification of pneumonia and help in accurate diagnosis [7, 8, 10, 11, 14] . Some cases with CT characteristics, such as ground-grass opacity (GGO) lesions following peripheral and crazy-paving patterns, combined with the history of epidemic exposure can be highly suspected of having novel coronavirus pneumonia. In this season, influenza is more common than COVID-19. An accurate diagnosis in the case of no epidemic exposure and no fever symptom is worth exploration. Recent studies [15, 16] have shown that the early identification, isolation, and treatment of COVID-19 were very important. However, direct comparisons of the imaging features of the two different forms of viral pneumonia have not been performed. This study aimed to investigate the differential diagnostic CT findings between influenza and COVID-19.

On 24 October 2012, a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome of unknown origin and symptom onset on 5 October was transferred from Qatar to a specialist lung clinic in Germany. Late diagnosis on 20 November of an infection with the novel Coronavirus (NCoV) resulted in potential exposure of a considerable number of healthcare workers. Using a questionnaire we asked 123 identified contacts (120 hospital and three out-of-hospital contacts) about exposure to the patient. Eighty-five contacts provided blood for a serological test using a two-stage approach with an initial immunofluorescence assay as screening test, followed by recombinant immunofluorescence assays and a NCoV-specific serum neutralisation test. Of 123 identified contacts nine had performed aerosol-generating procedures within the third or fourth week of illness, using personal protective equipment rarely or never, and two of these developed acute respiratory illness. Serology was negative for all nine. Further 76 hospital contacts also tested negative, including two sera initially reactive in the screening test. The contact investigation ruled out transmission to contacts after illness day 20. Our two-stage approach for serological testing may be used as a template for similar situations.

Differences in clinical signs between dogs and human beings caused by herniated disks arise not only from anatomic differences discussed previously, but also from postural differences and the application of shear and stress forces applied to the vertebrae and intervertebral disks. Human beings, with bipedal locomotion and erect posture, dissipate the forces of walking (also running) by transferring these forces from the legs up the vertebral column to the lumbar vertebrae (i.e., first in line to absorb and dissipate forces). In addition, lumbar vertebrae are not stabilized by the rib cage, and thus lumbar vertebrae must also absorb rotational forces (i.e., twisting forces) of motion. Therefore lumbar vertebrae are the primary sites affected. A similar virus has recently been recognized in ferrets and can cause similar lesions in the CNS. There are two recognized feline coronaviruses: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), which cause FECV and feline infectious peritonitis infections, respectively. The viruses for each infection are antigenically and morphologically indistinguishable and are currently considered to represent avirulent (FECV) and virulent (FIPV) strains of the same basic feline coronavirus. After ingestion, FECV infects and replicates in epithelial cells of the intestine and usually is an insignificant infection, although severe intestinal disease can occur. Recent research suggests that a mutation in the gene for the furin cleavage site of a spike protein (a structural glycoprotein) in the FECV viral envelope gives the virus the ability to mutate to FIPV and replicate in monocytes/ macrophages, use leukocyte trafficking (see Chapter 4) by these cells to spread systemically, and cause lesions characteristic of feline infectious peritonitis in other organ systems.

All medical staff and travellers to the Arabian Peninsula should be aware of a new epidemic caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which has emerged in the Arabian Peninsula (2012), secondary cases have been seen in Africa, Europe, Asia and the United States. It seems likely that the outbreak will continue with sporadic adventive cases occurring outside the Middle East, including Poland. Polish medical literature on MERS-CoV is rather scant. Therefore, the article describes etiology, epidemiology, symptoms and diagnostic methods of MERS-CoV infection which are available in Poland. Selected cases of patients infected with MERS-CoV are also presented followed by preventive methods. Comparisons between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are briefly described. Epidemiological and genetic studies point at zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV from camels and possibly bats. Infection is characterized by severe acute respiratory failure with a high fatality rate and the ability to spread from person to person; health care-associated outbreaks have been described. No known vaccine or antiviral therapy has been developed for MERS. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating the MERS-CoV in lower respiratory secretions by RT PCR. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals in the epidemic areas, should be adhered to. Health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis due to non-specific symptoms of MERS-CoV in the early stage of infection.

The tropism of respiratory tract pathogens make transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through skin unlikely 1 ; 20 thus, virus on hands is not directly dangerous. While RSV is introduced into the respiratory tract when 21 droplets are transferred to nose/eyes from contaminated hands 2 , the importance of fomite transmission 22 varies with different viruses 3 and the relative importance of self-inoculation in SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be 23 definitively determined. When considered as a vector, gloved hands are still able to transfer pathogens 24 between sites and do not obviate the need for proper hand hygiene 4 . In Singapore, a study of 36 25 infected healthcare workers and 50 controls found that gowns and gloves were not found to be 26 important in preventing the spread of the related virus SARS-CoV, while hand washing and N95 use 27 was. 5 In Hong Kong, comparison of 11 healthcare workers infected with SARS-CoV with uninfected 28 controls found only the use of masks (and not gowns, gloves, or handwashing) significant for infection 29 prevention in the final model. 6 Because contaminated hands and surfaces are a mechanism by which 30 some respiratory tract viruses spread 7 and, given the uncertainties of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we 31 require gloves for patient care for known COVID19 patients. We discourage double gloving (which is 32 more appropriate for blood-borne pathogens) and the use of gloves outside of patient care to conserve 33 supply, emphasizing the need for frequent hand hygiene. The need for gloves when patients are not 34 known to have SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. We require goggles or face shields when coming within 6 feet of COVID19 patients to protect eyes from 48 airborne droplets. The most important properties of protective eyewear are transparency of the 49 material and comfortable fit that holds the shield in place. Face shields may also reduce N95 mask 50 contamination. We have found that disposable face shields in common use are easily decontaminated 51 without reducing visibility or fit through several cycles. We have used dilutions of standard household 52 bleach (1 cup in 3-gallon water bath), 70% or greater concentrations of alcohol (produced by local 53 distilleries) and quaternary ammonium (commercially used by companies routinely performing 54 decontamination of medical facilities) for decontamination of disposable face shields. The former two 55 options take longer to dry; the latter requires manual wiping to remove residue from the face shields 56 before use. These options, along with alternates are recommended by the US Environmental Protection 57

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) SARS is a serious form of pneumonia and affected >8000 people worldwide, spreading to 30 countries across five continents, in the 2002-2003 outbreak. SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the responsible agent and was transmitted from wild animals to the human population [54, 55] , and delayed identification of this virus aided contagion. The SARS virus is detected in humans by RT-PCR [56, 57] indirect fluorescence assay, which detects anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in body fluids [58] and by isolation of SARS-CoV from clinical samples [59, 60] . Such viral culturing is time consuming, tedious and insensitive, therefore, PCR-and antibody-based detection methods are the predominant techniques adopted for surveillance. A highly sensitive and rapid bsAb-based immunoswab assay was developed for the early detection of SARS-CoV. This assay was superior to the traditional monoclonal ELISA-based assay [61] and detected the viral antigen nucleoplasmid protein (NP). Three different mAbs that recognize various epitopes on the NP antigen and the anti-HRPO mAb were utilized to generate the anti-SARS-CoV NP Â anti-HRPO bsAbs. This immunoswab assay showed NP detection limits of 10 pg/ml in saline, 20-200 pg/ml in pig nasopharyngeal aspirates, and 500 pg/ml in rabbit serum, thus, demonstrating the bispecific detection approach as superior in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The immunoswab assay facilitated rapid detection ($45 min) [61] and was robust, potentially permitting screening of numerous infected individuals within a short period of time, and hence, assisting to contain viral infection. Furthermore, by targeting the SARS-CoV spike protein (S1) in both mAband bsAb-based assays, to identify SARS infected individuals, it was also demonstrated that the bsAb detection reagent could improve the sensitivity of the assay from 37 to 19 ng/ml [62] .

This study analyzed and discussed available published genome until April 05, 2020, for a better understanding of the genomic variation and characterization of a novel coronavirus . This virus is transmitted from person to person via droplet transmission Ozaslan et al., 2020) . Therefore, the virus is spreading easily in overcrowded areas. Most patients experience only mild to moderate symptoms, such as high body temperature in conjunction with some respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and headache. Some people may have severe symptoms like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Chen et al., 2020) . Also, individuals with underlying complications such as heart disease, chronic lung disease, or diabetes potentially display more severe symptoms (Adhikari et al., 2020) . Preventive measures such as masks, frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, avoid public contact, and quarantines are being recommended for reducing the transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment is proven effective, hence, infected people initially rely on symptomatic treatments that showed encouraging profile for blocking the new coronavirus in early clinical trials.

F eline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease for wild and domestic felidae, caused by a Feline Coronavirus (FCoV). The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a mutated form of the enteric one (FECV) (Vennema et al 1995 , Poland et al 1996 . Both these FCoVs are able to pass from the intestine to the blood (Herrewegh et al 1995) ; unlike FECV, FIPV is able to replicate within the macrophages that phagocytose the virus in the lymph nodes and diffuse it through the body (Pedersen 1995a) . The development of the disease depends on the balance between humoral and cellular immunity: antibodies could facilitate the viral uptake by macrophages (Hodatsu et al 1993 , Hodatsu et al 1994 and in the absence of cell-mediated immunity, antigen-antibody complexes are responsible for a type III hypersensitivity reaction that leads to vasculitis and effusion (Hayashi et al 1977 , Pedersen, 1995a . Weak cellular immunity leads to dry forms, characterised by type IV hypersensitivity reactions (Pedersen 1987 , Paltrinieri et al 1998a . In vivo the two types of immune reactions probably coexist (Paltrinieri et al 1998b) . In experimental and in spontaneously occurring FIP, fluctuating levels of circulating antibodies and immune complexes as well as discrepancies between -globulin levels and antibody titre have been reported (Jacobse-Geels et al 1982 , Pedersen 1995a , Paltrinieri et al 1998b . The severity of the disease has been associated with a decrease of circulating lymphocytes (Ward et al 1974 , Pedersen 1995a , Paltrinieri et al 1998b . Furthermore, the distribution and the histological pattern of the lesions, as well as the distribution of viral antigens within the lesions, show great variations among the cats and often among different organs of the same cat (Weiss & Scott 1981 , Walter et al 1989 , Tammer et al 1995 , Kipar et al 1997 , Kipar et al 1998 , Paltrinieri et al 1998a .

All SARS-CoV-2 genomes represented in convenience samples from the COVID-19 pandemic appear closely genetically related with the large majority possessing between 0 and 12 mutations relative to a common ancestor estimated to exist in Wuhan between late Nov and early December 2019 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This pattern is consistent with a reported rate of molecular evolution of~0.8 × 10 -3 substitutions per site per year or~2 substitutions per genome per month ( 4 ) . After its initial emergence by the zoonotic route in Wuhan ( 10 ) , SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes began to accumulate substitutions and spread from Wuhan to other regions in the world ( 4 ) . During December 2019, the Wuhan outbreak was too small to seed many introductions outside of China, but by January 2020, it had grown large enough to begin seeding cases elsewhere in the world ( 11 ) . At this point, travel cases with origins in Hubei began to appear in the US. The first confirmed case recorded in the United States was a travel-associated case from an individual returning from Wuhan on 15 January 15 2020 who presented for care at an outpatient clinic in Snohomish County on 19 January 2020 and tested positive ( 12 ) . This infection is recorded as strain USA/WA1/2020 (referred to here as WA1) and appears closely related to viruses from infections in China (Fujian, Hangzhou and Guangdong provinces). Relative to the basal virus at root of the phylogeny, WA1 possesses mutations C8782T and T28144C (found in 74/224 sampled viruses from China) alongside C18060T (found in 6/224 sampled viruses from China).

Human cases of SARS originated in Guangdong province, southern China in November 2002. Able to efficiently spread between humans, the SARS virus resulted in a pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality [2] . The SARS coronavirus was of zoonotic origin [29] and Chinese wet markets were likely to have played an important role in the emergence of SARS. A similar virus was isolated in civet cats and racoon dogs in wet markets in Guangdong province during the pandemic [30] . After the initial spread from mainland China to Hong Kong, air travel was central to the global spread of the SARS virus. As with other outbreaks of newly emerged pathogens, infection control measures early in the pandemic were hampered by the lack of knowledge of the virus [31] . As a result, those countries with importations via international travel early in the pandemic, before the virus could be properly identified and proper control measures were in place, observed the highest number of cases outside China, including Canada, Singapore and Vietnam [32, 33] . VFR travel also played an important role in the SARS pandemic. The index case of SARS in Canada was a VFR traveller [34] . SARS demonstrated the importance of travellers in national disease control efforts aiming to prevent or delay the introduction of an emerging infectious disease and future pandemic planning. Part of that effort needs to be directed at VFR travellers and their role in spreading emerging infectious diseases across international borders.

Abstract A general compartmental model of disease transmission is studied. The generality comes from the fact that new infections may enter any of the infectious classes and that there is an ordering of the infectious classes so that individuals can be permitted (or not) to pass from one class to the next. The model includes staged progression, differential infectivity, and combinations of the two as special cases. The exact etiology of feline infectious peritonitis and its connection to coronavirus is unclear, with two competing theories – mutation process vs multiple virus strains. We apply the model to each of these theories, showing that in either case, one should expect traditional threshold dynamics. A further application to tuberculosis with multiple progression routes through latency is also presented.

We propose that the gut is an active site of replication for SARS-CoV-2 and this could account for the viremia observed in COVID-19 patients and for the presence of large amounts of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the feces. The origin of the replicating SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal epithelium is still not clear. To date only one paper reported the isolation of infectious virus from stool samples . Further characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 enteric lifecycle is necessary to determine whether the viral infection observed in the gut is due to fecal/oral transmission or is a manifestation of virus spreading from the lung to the gut. In the context of the gut we foresee that at the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection, human intestinal epithelial cells will mount an antiviral response through the type III IFN signaling pathway. As immune cells participate in mounting an innate immune response, type I IFN will be secreted from these cells and will be able to act on intestinal epithelial cells further reinforcing their antiviral state against SARS-CoV-2. In respect to the severe pathologies observed in the lung, which are believed to be caused by a cytokine storm, the findings that lung epithelial cells mount a muted immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that the cytokines are coming from an alternative source. This source could be from local immune cells but also from the gastro-intestinal mucosa given the large immune response generated by primary human intestinal epithelial cells. As a matter of fact, many cytokines are released from epithelial cells towards the lamina propria (tissue side) (Stanifer et al., 2016) , and will quickly enter the circulation to potentially fuel and promote the inflammation and pathology observed in the lung.

Events in any part of the world can affect the status of health of people in other parts of the globe. There is a dynamic interaction and interdependence so that a global approach is essential to achieve health targets, even locally. Without restating arguments elaborated throughout the text, current and future generations of public health professionals must be well aware of what is occurring outside their communities and countries. This means not only learning from the news media of outbreaks of exotic diseases, but also recognizing that the political, social, and economic upheavals that define everyday existence, across the street or halfway around the world, affect us all. Even the most remote communities in the world are not immune to the global impacts of distant military coups, civil wars, natural disasters, economic crises, or epidemics. In the spring of 2013, a new avian influenza virus, H7N9, appeared in China, with 131 cases and 36 deaths to the end of May 2013. Over 75 percent of the victims probably contracted the virus from poultry or in markets selling live chickens. Some caught the virus from family members, although no one seems to have been infected by breathing the same air as an infected person (Zhu et al., 2013) . A new coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), appeared in 2013 in Saudi Arabia and other countries of the Middle East, as well as among travelers from other countries including France and the UK. MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory illness with high mortality rates and may be transmitted from person to person, with 90 cases with 50 percent case fatality reported as of June 2013.

COVID-19 is transmitted from the carrier to the infected mainly through droplets and close unprotected contact, and there is a possibility of airborne transmission due to aerosols produced during medical procedures [3] . Thus, COVID-19 can be detected in ambient air of medical institutions [12] , which everyone is generally susceptible to [13] . It has been confirmed that there is human-to-human transmission and medical staff infection [13, 14, 15, 16] . By February 20, 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff in 476 hospitals were reported to have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection [3] , and most (88%) were from the Hubei Province and diagnosed in the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan. Therefore, the biosecurity protection of medical staff is of particular significance. Because patients in the incubation period could not be detected in time at the outset of the epidemic, the medical staff failed to implement graded protection and standard prevention protocols [15] , which resulted in nosocomial infections. After identifying the confirmed cases, the shortage of protective materials or gear and the lax implementation of hospital rules and regulations on nosocomial infections further exposed medical staff to the risk of nosocomial infection. In addition, nosocomial cross-infection among ordinary patients was not given due importance.

BACKGROUND: Real-time data collection of respiratory disease is important for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of disease transmission in the US. Healthcare professionals use tools such as FluView to help identify local pathogen circulation; however, these tools are limited to syndromic surveillance, and track a limited set of pathogens. Understanding respiratory disease dynamics requires 1) a large, pathogen rich data set 2) geographically dispersed data sources, and 3) fine temporal resolution. Here we utilize FilmArray® Trend, a research epidemiology system containing exported data from FilmArray® Respiratory Panel (RP) tests, to investigate geographic patterns of 20 common pathogens. METHODS: Over 6,000,000 individual pathogen assays from 19 clinical sites were exported to the Trend database from 2013 to present. Trend data were smoothed and normalized to produce the time series of pathogen incidence. A cross-correlation analysis was performed to compare sites to one another and determine offset of pathogen incidence. The results were plotted on a map of the US with visual indicators of correlation strength and directional movement as defined by cross-correlation lag values. RESULTS: The respiratory pathogens detected by the FilmArray RP test show a diverse set of spatial and temporal behaviors Most striking was the spread of the virus Coronavirus OC43, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), with RSV traveling from east coast sites to west coast sites across the US over 20 days. In contrast Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) shows a small cross-correlation lag across all of the Trend sites during the regular summer season, indicating near simultaneous onset of detection nationwide. A localized cluster of PIV3 in the winter of 2016 was observed in the midwest and west, identifying the significance of localized regional trends. CONCLUSION: FilmArray Trend shows great promise in deciphering spatiotemporal dynamics of these common respiratory pathogens. This system can identify localized outbreaks and directional movement of pathogens over time. Future work with finer geographic distribution of contributing sites will aide in making conclusions regarding spatial dynamics of all 20 RP pathogens. Other pathogen transmission models may also be explored using this data set. DISCLOSURES: C. Cook, BioFire Diagnostics: Employee, Salary. A. Wallin, BioFire Defense: Employee, Salary. A.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services followed with guidance on March 18, 2020 to limit "non-essential adult elective surgery and medical and surgical procedures, including all dental procedures" in an effort to (1) prevent further spread and (2) protect the resources of the health care systems currently caring for (or soon to be caring for) COVID-19 patients. As of April 1, 2020, 32 states have released statements addressing the issue of elective procedures during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.

COMMENTARY [Ann Emerg Med. 2013; 62:270-271.] Acute respiratory tract infection is a common reason prompting an emergency department (ED) visit. Although these illnesses are almost always caused by known respiratory pathogens, emergency physicians should recognize the risk of novel pathogens and be familiar with current recommendations for evaluating patients who may be infected with emerging pathogens from specific geographic areas. This report of a new coronavirus (now referred to as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV) identified in patients in the United Kingdom after travel to the Arabian Peninsula illustrates some important points about identifying infections with novel pathogens and implementing infection control procedures when specific transmission risk may be unknown. The 3 confirmed cases demonstrate that the virus has the capability of human-to-human transmission and coinfection with another pathogen (influenza A). 1 Subsequent clusters of disease confirm that the novel coronavirus can spread from person to person, including from patients to health care workers. Although MERS-CoV has a different genetic sequence than the virus that caused SARS, the implications for emergency medicine are similar. 2 Health care providers, hospital administrators, and global health organizations learned many important lessons during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The subsequent improvement in infection control measures is especially important for the ED in the event of infectious outbreaks with new pathogens. Transmission in the health care setting to a large number of health care workers and other patients was a notable feature of the SARS coronavirus. The greatest risk of transmission was to individuals who had close contact with infected subjects and who were not properly trained in the use of protective equipment. 3 Exposure of health care providers to procedures that aerosolized droplets such as nebulizers, suctioning, and intubation was another source of virus transmission. 4 N95 respirators may offer protection to individuals involved in highrisk procedures. 5 CDC recommendations for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette evolved during the SARS outbreak. These concepts have since been incorporated into CDC planning documents for SARS and pandemic influenza. Although basic precautions such as hand washing are intended for health care workers associated with direct patient contact, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette applies to everyone in the hospital setting: providers, patients, and visitors. 6 This concept was developed in response to observations that visitors and patients without diagnoses were contributing to hospital transmission. 3 Recommendations included posted signs in different languages about containment of respiratory secretions, convenient hand sanitizers and tissue receptacles, and sitting at least 3 feet apart if coughing. Screening patients with respiratory symptoms for recent travel, placing a mask, and isolation from others in the waiting room/ ED are important for early detection and prevention. 7 For pathogens that emerge in specified geographic areas, risk assessment is based on where the organism is currently circulating, ie, within the local community, limited geographic areas, or not actively circulating anywhere in the world. 8 If transmission is occurring only in limited areas (as with the coronavirus in this report), screening should focus on travel from those areas.

In studying the severity of infectious diseases, it is not always clear how much variation to attribute to the virulence of the pathogen and how much to the susceptibility of the host. In some situations, however, the pathogen can be regarded as a constant, thereby revealing the contribution of the host. For instance, the SARS coronavirus that spread from human to human during the 2003 outbreak came from a point source and was essentially an invariant clone. Yet we can discern at least three human host phenotypes of infection, namely, death, recovery, and superspreaders. Moreover, being a superspreader was not highly correlated with severity of disease, and luckily for the human population, superspreaders represented a small proportion of those who became infected. We do not know to what extent human genetic variation determined death, recovery, and infectiousness to others, but it should be studied. Doubtless, correlations will be found in the immunogenetics of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, other factors that are difficult to reduce to one type of gene-possibly specific differences in the coordinated multicell, multipathway response to SARS coronavirus-may have been involved.

COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. It mainly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets, similar to the common cold and influenza viruses (ie, through face-to-face contact accompanied by a sneeze or cough). It can also be transmitted through contact with the secretions of infected individuals. The role of fecal–oral transmission is yet to be determined for COVID-19, but it was found to occur during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [9]. The population is generally susceptible to the virus. Based on current epidemiological surveys, the latency period is usually 2-14 days (median 4 days), though longer cases have been noted [10]. COVID-19 is contagious during the latency period. At the time of submission of this paper, targeted antiviral drugs and vaccines were not yet available for COVID-19.

One type of medical intervention that has often been used for the purposes of IDC is vaccination. Vaccinations are amongst the most effective IDC interventions that societies can employ. For instance, broad vaccination coverage is largely responsible for the widespread immunity to measles and tetanus in modern society, and it led to the eradication of smallpox in the late twentieth century. 14 Barring adverse side-effects, which are uncommon for most vaccines, and cases where an individual is insusceptible to the negative effects of an infectious disease, being vaccinated is typically beneficial to the vaccinated individual, since an effective vaccine will normally confer immunity to a particular infectious disease. However, effective individual immunization also confers benefits to third parties: immunizing a sufficient proportion of the population against a disease can disrupt its spread from person to person. In such a scenario of herd immunity, the fact that a Justifications for Non-Consensual Medical Intervention sufficient majority of the population is immune to a particular disease confers a degree of protection even to those who have not been vaccinated. 15 In light of this third-party benefit, some countries employ laws that could be described as introducing coercive pressure on individuals to undergo vaccination, insofar as they provide for the imposition of costs for vaccine refusal. 16 For instance, in the majority of states in the USA, children must normally complete a vaccination schedule as a condition of entering public school. 17 In some cases, it might be claimed that if the operative reason undergirding an individual's choice to undergo the vaccination is that they desire to avoid these state-imposed costs of non-compliance (rather than, say, because they want the health benefits of being vaccinated), then that individual may qualify as being coerced in a manner that invalidates his consent. 18 Vaccinations aim to prevent the spread of infectious disease by preventing individuals from becoming infected in the first place. However, states also impose other sorts of non-consensual medical intervention for IDC purposes. For example, in some jurisdictions it is legally permissible to compel the medical examination (and in rare cases even treatment) of persons suspected of carrying an infectious disease. 19 The non-consensual examination and treatment of individuals carrying a dangerous infectious disease can aid IDC in two ways. First, effectively treating that individual will mean that that they will no longer be able to transmit the disease to others. Second, the treatment can help to restrict the development of drug-resistant pathogens, since one way in which a pathogen can develop drug resistance is by genetically evolving as a result of an incomplete treatment. 20 Although exerting coercive pressure to undergo vaccinations and even compelling medical examinations and treatments is permitted in some jurisdictions, these are somewhat controversial non-consensual IDC interventions. The use of non-consensual quarantine and isolation, however, is often deemed to be less controversial (for reasons that we shall explore below). Both quarantine and isolation share the aim of separating certain individuals from the rest of the community in order to prevent or limit the transmission of infectious pathogens. The difference between the two lies in the diagnostic status of the detainee: in isolation, it is known that the detainee is infected, whereas quarantine involves the detention of individuals who have been (or are likely to have been) exposed to the infectious agent and are thus suspected of being (but not known to be) infected. Quarantine and isolation have long been used in response to outbreaks of infectious disease, particularly those for which no effective medical treatment is available. 21 For instance, quarantine was widely used in response to the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.

Many studies make no mention of additional testing for endemic human respiratory viruses or bacteria (Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Devi et al., 2014) . When viruses are sought, they include some of the following: human herpesvirus (HHV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs), influenzaviruses (IFVs), endemic HCoVs, adenoviruses (AdVs) and metapneumovirus (MPV) and co-detections with MERS-CoV do occur (Bermingham et al., 2012; Drosten et al., 2013 ; Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation Team, 2013; Memish et al., 2013b) . When included, other viruses are often absent in the samples positive for MERS-CoV Bermingham et al., 2012; Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Omrani et al., 2013) but have been found in samples negative for MERS-CoV during such rare MERS investigations (Reuss et al., 2014) . Tests on the first human case in the KSA used a LRT sample to isolate MERS-CoV in culture, conduct immunofluorescence for some viruses (negative for IFV, PIVs, RSV and AdVs) and RT-PCR for other viruses (negative for AdV, EVs, MPV and HHVs) . RT-PCR also detected MERS-CoV. A case exported to Greece in April-2014 was tested (and found negative) for IFVs, Legionella and Pneumococcus . Other bacterial testing has been conducted but the impact of bacterial copresence is also unclear Devi et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013b; Tsiodras et al., 2014) . Two MERS cases that travelled from the KSA to the Netherlands were negative for RSV, AdV, bocavirus (BoV), PIVs, HCoVs, HRV, IFVs, RSV and MPV (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . Testing for other respiratory pathogens is strongly recommended (World Health Organization, 2013b) but limited data address the occurrence of co-infections or alternative viral diagnoses among both cases and contacts suspected of MERS-CoV infection. Little is known of other causes of MERS-like pneumonia in the KSA or of the general burden of disease due to the known classical respiratory viruses including endemic other human coronaviruses.

Spreading patterns of COVID-19 at different spatial scales, from local (railway department and department store) to regional (cities within Guangdong Province) to nationwide (Provinces within China), appear similar: new cases arise from contacts with a reservoir, spreading to remote locations through travel from the origin outbreak region. There likely is some secondary spread locally, from cases infected from the reservoir, but local reproduction numbers are low, often insufficient to support sustained transmission. Knowledge of the serial interval, for symptomatic cases in the outbreak, is essential for analysis of the transmission probabilities [14] . Previous studies have estimated the distribution of serial intervals from a set of confirmed transmission pairs, where both the ancestor (who caused infection) and the descendant (who became infected) were known [19, 20] . As such information is mostly lacking [6] (and may be hard to obtain) in this COVID-19 outbreak, we have estimated the serial interval distribution from a curated network, using whatever contact information was available. Existing knowledge of contacts (and timing of those contacts) between cases was used to construct a matrix of prior probabilities, to restrict the transmission network to only those links that are possible. When all transmission links are known, the serial interval distribution can be easily estimated. However, at early stages of an outbreak, information on transmission links is usually incomplete. When a sufficiently large proportion of the transmission links is known, it is possible to estimate both the serial interval distribution, and the transmission probability matrix [14] . Starting from a plausible serial interval distribution, the transmission probability matrix V is updated until convergence; then V is frozen and the serial interval parameters are updated, again until obtaining a new optimum; then the serial interval distribution is frozen and the transmission probability matrix is updated again, and so on, until no further improvement can be found. The estimated serial interval distribution, Gamma(3·16,1·52), has a mean of 4·8 days and good spread out (i.e. large scale parameter) to long serial interval. The variation of serial interval could caused by highly varied incubation period [21] . Such a short serial interval, compared to SARS (mean: 8·4 days) [22] and MERS (mean: 6·8 days) [23], gives COVID-19 ability to spread more rapidly. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea (from 31 cases on 18 February to 2,022 cases on 28 February) and Italy (from 20 cases on 21 February to 650 cases on 28 February), shows how missed infectious subjects may cause rapid transmission within a very short period, due to the combination of a short serial interval and an occasionally high reproduction number [24] . As the incubation period seems to be highly variable, it may be possible that appearance of symptoms in any case precedes symptom onset in its ancestor. When that happens, the serial interval for symptom onset is negative. To check whether negative serial intervals would adversely affect analysis we used an alternative distribution, where the serial intervals were shifted leftward by a small amount. A shift of one or two days had no destructive effect on estimation of V , and the resulting estimates of the effective reproduction numbers did not change substantially. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint Early transmission of a newly emerging infectious disease in a population lacking immunity could reveal the basic reproduction number as long as there is no intervention. Currently, the source of COVID-19 is still unclear but many of the early cases were reported to have had contact with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A recent announcement released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences indicated that the source may not have come from this Seafood Market [25] . Any patient zero would have occurred before the initial 425 confirmed cases, but lacking any specific information about early spread of COVID-19, it can be assumed that a reservoir of infectious subjects could function as a super-spreading node causing new infections upon contact at any time within the outbreak. Assuming such a source for the initial cluster in Wuhan ("the Market") led to an estimated basic reproduction number 13·6. It must be noted that this environmental "super-spreading node" is hypothetical, and represents the production of new cases by the joint presence of infectious subjects connected to the initial source. There was strong heterogeneity in disease transmission in different provinces of mainland China. The present analysis produces two relevant characteristics: the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan, and the average reproduction number for the first five days after any confirmed imported case in each province. When there are many imported cases from Wuhan, these constitute a large base number of cases to start local spreading of the disease. Provinces geographically close to Hubei province are expected to experience mass migration from Wuhan, especially near the holiday season. Provinces with big tier-1 cities like Zhejiang and Guangdong both have very high estimated numbers of cases imported from Wuhan due to their economic connection with Hubei. When early transmission has a high reproduction number, local growth rate in a province will be high. Provinces geographically distant from Hubei, like Hebei, Guizhou, and Shandong, appear to have relatively high reproduction numbers during early local transmission. In provinces distant from Wuhan, the central hub of the outbreak, inhabitants and local governments may have been less cautious (with few public and personal prevention measures) considering high costs of interventions and perceived low risk. Since Guangdong province has both large numbers of imported cases and high reproduction numbers for early transmission, we further examined the transmission inside of Guangdong by city. Shenzhen and Guangzhou, two of the biggest cities in China, had many imported cases. This is expected considering intense economic connectivity: transportation links, for goods and people including enormous numbers of migrant workers working in those two cities. The numbers of cases imported from Wuhan into other cities in Guangdong province was smaller. This pattern matches the flow of people in public transport (by train and airplane) converging onto the main transportation hubs (Shenzen and Guangzhou) and diverging from there towards other destinations in Guangdong province. For early transmission following import from Wuhan, the reproduction number in most cities in Guangdong had an average reproduction number around 1, during the first five days. With appropriate and sustained disease prevention and control measures (e.g. suspension public transportation, cancellation of mass gatherings, implementation of surveillance, and promotion of wearing face masks and personal hygiene), the outbreak is unlikely to spread out in those cities.

The human coronaviruses are known major pathogens of respiratory diseases that are highly infectious and communicable. For instance, the SARS-CoV can be transmitted directly from civets to humans; the MERS-CoV can be transmitted from dromedary camels to human. There is also evidence of human to human transmission. As earlier stated, SARS-CoV-2 possesses certain similar characteristics as SARS-CoV. When an individual comes in contact with a SARS-CoV-2, the virus targets major routes where it can easily propagate to get to target cells and mediate infection. Coronaviruses are respiratory viruses; thus, their first major target is the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract where they bind to receptors (the ACE-2) [12] . By binding to the ACE-2 expressed on the respiratory epithelial cells, the SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 not only mediates infection but also facilitates their replication and transmission [2, 12, 15, 16] . This marks the genesis of the pathology of the virus.

There are two ERAD models for protein degradation: ubiquitin-proteasome ERAD, designated as ERAD (I), and autophagy-lysosome ERAD, designated as ERAD (II) (Fujita et al., 2007; Korolchuk et al., 2010) . Both models depend on retrotranslocation of ERAD substrates from the ER back to the cytoplasm with the help of the Cdc48p-p97 complex. Most soluble misfolded proteins are cleared through the ubiquitinproteasome system, which involves action of a cascade of three canonical ubiquitin enzymes: E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme initiates the reaction by using ATP to covalently activate and then conjugate the ubiquitin to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Ubiquitin is then transferred from the ubiquitin-charged E2 to the lysine residue of a specific target or a growing ubiquitin chain by E3 ubiquitin ligase, which results in a multiubiquitin chaintagged substrate. Proteins that are ubiquitinated with K48-linked chains are specifically recognized by the 26S proteasome and subjected to degradation (Hershko et al., 1983) . In contrast, ERAD (II) degrades both soluble and insoluble misfolded protein aggregates in autolysosome. Autophagy receptors and adaptors, called p62/SQSTM1, NBR1, HDAC6, and ALFY, bind to proteins with K63-specific monoubiquitination or polyubiquitin chains and then guide them to the concave side of developing autophagosomes (Behrends and Fulda, 2012) . Notably, p62 also recognizes K48 polyubiquitin-tagged proteins for autophagic clearance upon proteasome dysfunction. In addition to the protective role of UPR, prolonged and/or excess ER stress typically activates caspase-12, an ER-resident caspase, leading to UPR-mediated cell death (Szegezdi et al., 2006) .

The data were collected by the first author, who is a sociologist, along with three anthropologists, who all had extensive experience in collecting qualitative data. Before data collection commenced we thoroughly reviewed the research objectives, research tools and specific data collection techniques to effectively and efficiently collect quality data. During in-depth interviews, lasting from 35 min to 60 min, and focus group discussions, ranging from 55 min to 90 min, we used an interview guide that started by asking people to list all of the illnesses they could think of that they associated with respiratory functions. We also asked about their perceptions on causes of respiratory illness, how respiratory infections are passed from one person to another, how disease transmission can be prevented, existing social norms, current practices related to respiratory hygiene, and for suggestions of messages and channels to promote respiratory hygiene behavior. We also conducted unstructured observations in markets to see respiratory hygiene practices in public places. During observation, we took notes about customers' and shopkeepers' behaviors linked to respiratory hygiene (Appendix 3). Nevertheless we did not count the events as we conducted unstructured observations in extremely crowded market places. Rather than quantify, we were more interested in observing people's actual respiratory hygiene practices including: whether people covered their mouths during coughing or sneezing; if so, how they covered their mouths (with hands/upper arm/ cloth); whether they turned away from others while coughing or sneezing; whether they spat on the ground; and whether they washed their hands after nasal cleaning or coughing or sneezing into hands.

Viruses are the smallest infectious agents containing only one type of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) covered by a protein coat, which may be surrounded by a lipid-containing membrane. A virion is composed of viral proteins, nucleic acid, lipids and carbohydrates. The structural proteins of viruses protect the viral genome, participate in attachment of virus to a susceptible cell, facilitate transfer of viral nucleic acid from one host cell to another and are antigenic determinants of the virus. Viral envelopes contain lipids and glycoproteins (gp), the lipids are derived from the host cell while the glycoproteins are virus-encoded. Surface glycoproteins attach the virus to a target cell and are important viral antigens. Viral proteins coded by nonstructural genes are known as nonstructural proteins (NS) . Present in the virus-infected cells, these proteins appear to have regulatory roles during replication. To give a few examples, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genes code for NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B nonstructural proteins. The mature structural proteins are C, E1 and E2 [6] .

Although there were reports of pregnant women with SARS from several countries, the number of reported cases is too small to permit any definitive conclusions as to whether SARS was more or less severe among pregnant women as compared with nonpregnant women. Among the cases of SARS that have been reported among pregnant women, there were no reports of perinatal transmission of SARS. [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] The largest case series of pregnant women with SARS was from Hong Kong; 12 pregnant patients, including 5 pregnant healthcare workers, with SARS were admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hong Kong. 41 Three of the 12 pregnant patients with SARS died, for a case fatality rate of 25%. Seven of the 12 pregnant women with SARS were infected in the first trimester, and 5 of the women were infected in the second or third trimester. Among the 7 women who were infected in the first trimester, 4 women had spontaneous abortions, and 2 women had induced abortions. Of the 5 women who were infected later in pregnancy, 3 women underwent preterm cesarean delivery (26-32 weeks of gestation) for worsening maternal hypoxemia; 2 of the 3 women who underwent cesarean delivery subsequently died. Although the number of evaluated patients was small, pregnant women with SARS were more likely to require admission to the intensive care unit, to experience renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and to die than nonpregnant control subjects. 38 Followup information was reported for the 5 liveborn infants who were born to pregnant women who were infected with SARS during the second or third trimesters. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of SARS among the infants, despite a systematic search for perinatal transmission that included serial reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction assays, viral cultures, and paired serologic titers. 15 There were also cases of pregnant women with SARS from mainland China 42,43 and 2 cases from the United States. 37, 39, 40 Notably, 2 of the 8 persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS in the United States were pregnant women. 40 A 36-year-old pregnant woman at 19 weeks of gestation had traveled from the United States to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong Province to visit family members. She stayed on the same floor of ''Hotel M'' during the same time as the 65year-old ill physician who is credited with infecting the other guests. On return to the United States, she was hospitalized for pneumonia and required mechanical ventilation. Serum specimens were positive for the SARS coronavirus antibody. She was delivered at 38 weeks of gestation by cesarean delivery for placenta previa. The infant appeared uninfected by SARS, although specimens were not obtained for testing. 37, 39 The second case involved a 38-year-old woman at 7 weeks of gestation who also traveled to Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic. After recovering from her illness, she had a relatively unremarkable pregnancy. At 36 weeks of gestation, she had preterm labor and spontaneous rupture of membranes and underwent an emergency cesarean delivery because of fetal distress. The infant appeared normal, and no virus was detected in stool samples. 40 For obstetrician-gynecologists, there are several important lessons from the SARS pandemic. Although the United States was spared relatively during this outbreak, the global response to this outbreak may provide important clues about how to respond to future health threats. During an outbreak of a disease like SARS in which nosocomial spread plays an important role, the implications for a busy obstetric unit that provides urgent medical care on a 24-hour basis to primarily healthy pregnant women and their newborn infants are enormous. Staff from several large obstetric units in Toronto 44, 45 and Hong Kong [46] [47] [48] provided detailed reports about the challenges that they faced responding to SARS, an emerging infectious disease about which very little was known. In a Toronto hospital, the timing was ideal because the obstetrics unit was able to move into a newly designed facility with separate entrances, elevators, and air handling systems. Staff were instructed to use appropriate personal protective equipment (masks, face-shield or eye protection, gown, non-latex gloves), and all patients and visitors wore masks. In addition, visitors were limited to 1 visitor during labor and delivery, and no visitors were allowed after the delivery. The length of the postpartum stay was decreased, and after discharge women were instructed to stay at home under quarantine for 10 days. All physicians and healthcare workers were asked to observe work quarantine and were allowed to go directly to work and home with minimal contact with the public. 44, 45 In Hong Kong, obstetric services were transferred to a hospital that was separate from where SARS cases were being treated. Women were discharged sooner after delivery, and all nonessential obstetric services (such as routine ultrasound examinations and prenatal diagnosis) were suspended temporarily. [46] [47] [48] The basic principles of the responses in Toronto and Hong Kong included keeping healthy pregnant women away from potentially infectious SARS cases.

Multiple lines of evidence implicate dromedary camels in the emergence and transmission of MERS-CoV. Firstly, MERS-CoV antibodies are highly prevalent in dromedary camels from across the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa and Eastern Africa ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). [29] [30] [31] 34, [69] [70] [71] MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in stored camel sera dating as far back as early 1990s, suggesting that MERS-CoV may have been circulating in dromedaries for over 20 years before it was first recognized as a cause of human infection. 32, 71, 72 The prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is significantly higher in older camels compared with those aged two years or less. 31, 32, 73, 74 Interestingly, despite the high overall prevalence of MERS-CoV seropositivity in dromedary camels from Kenya, no MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in those from the North Eastern region where dromedaries have been raised largely in isolation from those in the rest of the country. 71 Similarly, all dromedaries raised at the Dubai Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, which had no contact with other camels, were seronegative for MERS-CoV. 75 Also noteworthy is that 15 of 105 dromedary camels from the Canary Islands were seropositive for MERS-CoV. Although the majority of camels in the herd were born and bred in the Canary Islands, the group included three camels that were imported from Morocco. 29 In contrast, no MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in dromedary camels from Australia, Canada, the United States of America, Germany, the Netherlands or Japan. 29, 34, 72, 75, 76 The high prevalence of MERS-CoV seropositivity in Africa and the Middle East suggests that animal movement has facilitated the transmission and circulation of MERS-CoV amongst dromedary camels in these regions. MERS-CoV antibodies have neither been found in Mongolian or Dutch bactrian camels, nor in South American camelids such as lamas, alpacas and guanacos. 29, 77 The second line of evidence is the reported detection of MERS-CoV by RT-PCR in oro-nasal and faecal samples from dromedary camels in multiple locations in the Arabian Peninsula ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ). 32, 70, 73, 74, [78] [79] [80] [81] The four of 110 dromedary camels in which MERS-CoV RNA was detected in Egypt were all imported from Sudan or Ethiopia for slaughter. 82 Of particular concern is the particularly high rate of MERS-CoV RNA detection in camels presented for slaughter in Eastern Saudi Arabia and Qatar; the latter was in the vicinity of a market in Doha to which two prior human cases were linked. 78, 79 Overall, MERS-CoV is more commonly detected and in higher viral loads in nasal swabs than in faecal samples. 32, 73, 74 Another notable observation is that sequences from MERS-CoV strains isolated several months apart within the same location are often identical to one another, indicating that MERS-CoV circulation in dromedary herds is very stable. 73, 74 Interestingly, the prevalence of MERS-CoV RNA shedding is significantly higher in juvenile than in adult camels that had prior evidence of MERS-CoV seropositivity, indicating that animal re-infection is possible. 73, 74, 79, 83 The third level of evidence is the demonstration of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels through documented rises in anti-MERS-CoV antibody titres. 73, 74, 85, 86 MERS-CoV was also detected by RT-PCR in symptomatic camels. 73, 74, 78, 83, 85, 86 Dromedaries with active MERS-CoV infection exhibited symptoms such muco-purulent nasal and lachrymal discharge, cough, sneezing, fever and loss of appetite. 73, 78, 85, 86 It was initially argued that detection of MERS-CoV in camels by RT-PCR is not necessarily evidence of shedding of infectious virus and thus transmissibility of MERS-CoV between dromedaries and humans. 87, 88 However, several groups have since been able to isolate viable MERS-CoV in cell cultures of nasal and faecal samples from dromedary camels. 73, 74, 80, 84, 89 Moreover, the potential infectiousness of MERS-CoV recovered from dromedary camels was evident by its capability to cause ex-vivo infection in human respiratory cells and human hepatoma cells (Huh-7) . 80, 90 Successful MERS-CoV cultures usually coincide with corresponding high viral loads in the same specimens. 73, 80, 82, 84 The fifth level of evidence is the successful experimental MERS-CoV infection of dromedary camels with resultant mild clinical infection manifesting as fever and rhinorrhea. 91 Three MERS-CoV seronegative adult dromedary camels were inoculated via intranasal, intra-tracheal camels. 32, 73, 74, 78 In one prospective study, MERS-CoV detection by RT-PCR in dromedary camels was highest in the period between the months of November and January, coinciding with the dromedaries' calving season. 78 This, along with the observed increased incidence of human MERS-CoV infection during the period between March and May, suggests that juvenile camels are an important source of new infections in camels and potentially hum ans. 73, 74, 78 MERS-CoV RNA prevalence data also indicate that animal movement may facilitate the introduction of MERS-CoV into herds of dromedaries. For example, phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV strains that were detected in a herd of dromedary camels in Dubai showed that they were closely related to those circulating in Eastern Saudi Arabia, where some of the camels had recently grazed. 74 In another example, a group of camels imported from Oman was screened by RT-PCR on arrival in UAE and was found positive for MERS-CoV. 83 Moreover, MERS-CoV strains isolated from dromedary camels in Eastern Saudi Arabia were phylogenetically related to those isolated from camels several hundred kilometres away in Buraidah, central Saudi Arabia. 73 Most significantly, phylogenetic analyses of partial and whole MERS-CoV genomes from dromedary camels show that they are clustered within human isolates, supporting possible camel-human intertransmission. 32, 70, 73, 74, 78, 80, 82, 84 RT-PCR was positive in co-worker were diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR in five of their 14 camels. 89 Alignment of six MERS-CoV genomic fragments, covering 4.2 kb of the MERS-CoV genome, from the camels and the human cases showed that they differed by one nucleotide each in ORF1a and ORF4b regions. 89 In November 2013, a 43-year-old man died in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with severe MERS-CoV infection. He had owned a herd of nine dromedary camels, some of which were reported to have had recent respiratory symptoms. MERS-CoV was detected by PCR and culture of nasal specimens from one camel. 85, 86 Partial MERS-CoV sequence of 4.6 kb from the camel and the linked human isolates differed in only two positions. 85 Whole MERS-CoV genome sequences obtained from viral cultures of the human and camel isolates were 100% identical. 86 Importantly, 4-fold rise in MERS-CoV antibody titres was documented in the camels, indicating that active MERS-CoV infection was probably circulating in the dromedary herd. 85, 86 Later, rising MERS-CoV antibodies were documented in the patient, suggesting that MERS-CoV infection was transmitted from the camels to the human and not vice versa. 86 In May 2015, MERS-CoV was detected in eight asymptomatic dromedary camels at entry into UAE from Oman. Two asymptomatic men, aged 29 and 33 years, who were in contact with the camels were found to be positive for MERS-CoV RNA in their respiratory samples. 83 Partial sequences of MERS-CoV spike, ORF3-4a and nucleocapsid regions from the human and linked camels were and conjunctival routes with a total dose of 10 7 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV. Clinical symptoms appeared within 2 days and persisted for up to 2 weeks. Submucosal inflammation and necrosis were evident in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, but not the alveoli. MERS-CoV antibodies were detected within 14 days of inoculation. Shedding of infectious MERS-CoV in oral and nasal secretions, as determined by plaque assay titres, continued for up 5 and 7 days, respectively. MERS-CoV was detectable by quantitative PCR for up to 35 days. 91 Under certain condition, MERS-CoV can survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 30 hours. 92 Moreover, MERS-CoV RNA can be detected in milk expressed from MERS-CoV infected camels. 93 Whether MERS-CoV is secreted in camel milk or it is contaminated from the animal's other body secretions is probably immaterial as viable MERS-CoV can be recovered from dromedary camel milk stored at 22 degrees Celsius for up to 48 hours. 94 It is therefore possible to envisage that in the absence of appropriate precautions, the environment surrounding a MERS-CoV infected camel can become extensively contaminated with viable, potentially infectious virus.

The Final Results worksheet in the supplemental file shows representative quantitative results for 10 clinical diagnostic samples and 4 controls. The clinical samples are a subset of the types of samples routinely tested including nasal/oropharyngeal swabs, lung tissue, and fecal samples. One (equine) fecal sample in this set shows a failed MS2 internal control, which indicates the presence of inhibitors in the sample. This is typically managed by dilution of the eluted sample and/or re-extraction. As is the case here, the negative amplification control should be negative for all targets, and the negative extraction control should only contain the internal control. In the clinical set, samples produced Ct values for betacoronavirus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine distemper virus A, canine parainfluenza virus, canine pneumovirus, and influenza A. Table 1 .

In sharp contrast, the replication of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) benefits from ADAR1 editing. 178 The editing of HDV RNA by ADAR1 converts the UAG stop codon to a UIG tryptophan codon, allowing the synthesis of a larger HDV antigen. 179 Without viral RNA editing, the HDV genome cannot be packaged into a virion. 179 Nonetheless, ADAR overexpression increases RNA editing but decreases HDV replication. 180 IFN-inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) family IFITM family members, including IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3, inhibit, in an IFITM-specific manner, the replication of diverse pathogenic membrane-enveloped viruses, including Marburg virus and Ebola (EBOV) filoviruses; severe acute respiratory coronavirus; HIV; Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV); respiratory syncytial virus; reovirus; flaviviruses, including DenV and WNV; and HCV. [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] In contrast, IFITMs show no inhibitory effects on entry of amphotropic mouse leukemia virus, Machupo virus, Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 183 IFITMs are topologically located at different intracellular membrane compartments. IFITM2 and IFITM3, which are type II transmembrane proteins, are primarily localized to endosomes and lysosomes, 187, 188 whereas IFITM1 also localizes to the cell periphery. 189, 190 IFIT3 interacts with TBK1, IRF3 and other IFITM members and enhances IFN signaling. 191, 192 Lipid raft membranes, which are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, play vital roles in cellular pathways and in virus entry, assembly and budding. 193, 194 Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and oxysterolbinding protein (OSBP) modulate the intracellular trafficking and de novo synthesis of cholesterol. 195 VAPA interacts with OSBP to regulate the transfer of cholesterol from the ER to other organelles. 196, 197 The regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, particularly in the endosomal compartment, is critical for the entry of viruses such as EBOV and Marburg viruses. 198 IFITMs have been demonstrated to interfere with virus infection by blocking virus-endosome fusion (Table 1) , 183, 184 presumably through the modification of cellular membrane properties, such as fluidity and spontaneous curvature. 184, 188, 199 Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al. 188 demonstrated that the interaction of IFITM3 with VAPA antagonizes the association of VAPA with OSBP, thereby inducing the accumulation of cholesterol in multivesicular bodies and in late endosomes. The disruption of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis subsequently impairs the membrane fusion of intraluminal virion-containing vesicles and endosomes, resulting in a block of VSV release into the cytosol. 188 Using immortalized human hepatocytes and Huh7 infection models, Raychoudhuri demonstrated that IFITM1 expression inhibits HCV replication but not at virus entry. 200 Later, Wilkins et al. 186 identified that IFITM1 is a hepatocyte tight junction protein whose antiviral action occurs through modification of the interactions of the HCV coreceptors CD81 and occludin, thereby inhibiting HCV entry (Table 1) . 186 This study represents an interesting mode of antiviral innate immunity; an ISG can exert its anti-HCV action by disrupting viral coreceptor associations.

Mapping the host, viral and environmental determinants of airborne transmission of influenza viruses has been on the research agenda already for many years. Ferrets are a wellestablished model for both transmission and pathogenesis of influenza viruses and have been used in influenza research since the early 1930s (Smith, Andrewes and Laidlaw 1933) . There are two major advantages of the ferret model compared to other models, such as mice. First, ferrets are readily susceptible to infection with avian, swine and human influenza viruses without the need of prior adaptation. Moreover, depending on the influenza virus strain they are infected with, ferrets manifest symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract (URT, LRT) disease and pathology similar to that observed in humans (Smith, Andrewes and Laidlaw 1933; Reuman, Keely and Schiff 1989) . In the ferret transmission model, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses isolated from humans are transmitted from an infected ferret to an uninfected ferret via the airborne route, whereas avian viruses are generally not (Linster et al. 2014 ). In addition to the ferret model, guinea pig transmission models were recently developed because they are more practical and less expensive (Lowen et al. 2006) . Guinea pigs can also be readily infected with human and avian influenza viruses without adaptation but they display different symptoms upon influenza virus infection than ferrets and humans. Although influenza viruses can replicate to high titers in the respiratory tract of guinea pigs, they generally do not display severe disease upon infection with influenza viruses, even with strains that are pathogenic for humans and ferrets such as H5N1 viruses (Kwon, Lipatov and Swayne 2009) . Despite these differences in symptoms and disease severity, similar general conclusions on the transmissibility of human and avian viruses can be reached using the ferret and guinea pig model (Bouvier and Lowen 2010) . One of the great advantages of the guinea pig model is the possibility to cover areas of research difficult to study with the larger and more expensive ferret model. Guinea pigs can be kept in controlled climate chambers that are large enough to house multiple pairs of animals, to study the impact of environmental parameters such as temperature or humidity on influenza virus transmission (Lowen et al. 2007 (Lowen et al. , 2008 Steel, Palese and Lowen 2011) . The more economical and less demanding guinea pig model has also allowed increasing the number of replicates and therefore the statistical power of transmission experiments.

In addition, another family of three who travelled from Wuhan to Guangzhou was reported to be infected with COVID-19. 4 The father had clinical symptoms, a decreased lymphocyte count, abnormal chest CT images, and a positive result on qRT-PCR.

The sudden escalation of the control and the spread of the number of infected and deaths, however, ignited strong emotional responses of fear and panic among people in Wuhan. The negative emotional responses soon spread from Wuhan to other parts of China, and further to the world via almost all communication channels, particularly social media. The highly emotional responses of the public were fueled by (1) sudden increases in the number of detected new cases after the massive intervention measures to identify the infected; (2) massive growing needs for masks; (3) a large number of suspected patients waiting to confirm their diagnose; (4) a large number of diagnosed COVID-19 patients for treatment; and (5) a growing number of deaths, despite national efforts to improve therapy, including the decision to build two large hospitals within a period of days. The emotional responses, mostly stimulated by the daily release of data have created a big barrier for effective control of the epidemic as has been observed in other epidemics of similar nature [2, 3].

Nosocomial transmission of CRVs is common, and widespread hospital outbreaks of CRVs have occurred with sometimes devastating sequelae [5, 6] . Because these viruses are so easily transmitted from person to person in both inpatient and outpatient settings, infection control measures and enforcement of these measures are critical in controlling the spread of these infections [5] [6] [7] . Community outbreaks of RSV infections typically occur during the late fall, winter, and early spring, frequently followed by outbreaks of human metapneumovirus. Influenza outbreaks typically occur during the winter in temperate climates, but may occur throughout the year in more tropical areas. Parainfluenza virus infections occur throughout the year, with outbreaks occurring primarily in the spring, summer, and fall. Other viruses, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses, tend to take place throughout the year, although sporadic outbreaks of all these respiratory viruses may occur.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus that emerged in 2019 and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 1,2 SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. It differs from other respiratory viruses in that it appears that human-tohuman transmission occurs approximately 2 to 10 days prior to the individual becoming symptomatic. [2] [3] [4] The virus is transmitted from person to person through respiratory secretions. Large droplets from coughing, sneezing or rhinorrhoea land on surfaces within 2 m of the infected person. SARS-CoV-2 remains viable for at least 24 hours on hard surfaces and up to 8 hours on soft surfaces. 5 The virus is transferred to another person through hand contact on a contaminated surface followed by touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Aerosol airborne infected particles created during a sneeze or cough remain viable in the air for 3 hours. 5 These airborne particles of SARS-CoV-2 can then be inhaled by another person or land on the mucosal membranes of the eyes.

During the 1980s, the epidemiology of human immunosuppressive virus, HIV, was starting to unfold, not least in the demonstration of how easily it may be spread via re-used syringes and needles. An outbreak at a paediatric hospital in Kalmyk, Romania in 1989 was traced to a sailor from a Russian trade ship, which had visited the west coast of Africa. He had infected his wife: their newborn baby, who had also contracted HIV, was treated at the hospital. Intravenous antibiotics were administered by the same syringe for all patients: the tiny amount of blood drawn up each time was enough to infect several other children. Outbreaks subsequently occurred at Elista and Rostov-on-Don and investigation showed these to be due to a genetically similar strain of HIV. The practice of using pooled gammaglobulin in Romania was also shown to contribute to the spread of HIV in a cluster of over 1000 infected orphans who had been treated with gammaglobulin -and there are continued concerns about the role of routine immunisation programmes in spreading this virus. Virus by railway -SARS and civets [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The global outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which emerged in Hong Kong in February 2002 presented yet another new human pathogen, traced eventually to a zoonotic corona virus that had jumped species. The main reservoir was thought to have been civets, used in cooking in China. Civets (cat-like animals not related to domestic cats) were regularly sold in live markets and somehow infected humans in the Guangdong Province of China, causing an atypical pneumonia with high mortality. A medical doctor who had treated patients with this atypical pneumonia travelled to Hong Kong by rail to attend a marriage, and stayed one night in a Hong Kong hotel. He had a high fever and cough when he arrived at the hotel, and several people staying in the same hotel were infected, with subsequent cases identified in other countries in Asia and as far as Europe and North America. So animal trading was only the source of infection, which then spread easily from human to human: the epidemic curve showed that infections in health care workers (for example, 10 in Singapore) had driven the transmission to family members and into the local community. This amplification of transmission was a further demonstration of the role of substandard infection control in health care facilities, including laboratory accidents. The SARS virus is thought to have been a single mutation from a strain of the virus that previously only caused disease in humans: animal traders showed evidence of being infected, but had no history of illness, prior to the SARS outbreak. Thanks mainly to a worldwide collaborative effort, the outbreak was contained by July 2003. Containment was facilitated by the low infectivity of the mutated virus: by contrast, the Influenza strain causing 'Swine flu' is much more infective and prevention will be the best way to contain the outbreaks it causes.

In general, it is well understood that transmission by close contact plays an important role in the spreading of infectious diseases (Halloran et al., 2010) . In particular, infection risk is affected by the number of contacts along with other factors such as the humanhuman distance or the type and duration of contact itself (De Cao et al., 2014) . This is well acknowledged for the pandemic influenza (Haber et al., 2007) and specifically in the case of varicella and parvovirus (Melegaro et al., 2011) , as well as for SARS-CoV-1 (Riley et al., 2003) . Coronaviruses are known as important veterinary pathogens and are also a cause of the common cold in people. In the last 20 years, the picture has changed as three major outbreaks of severe respiratory disease have been caused by coronaviruses. In 2002 and 2003, a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) drew attention to the pandemic potential of novel coronaviruses. SARS caused 8096 known cases and 774 deaths before the outbreak was controlled in less than a year through vigorous quarantine measures. Ten years later, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged, causing even more concern due to its high case fatality rate. MERS is not efficiently transmitted from person to person, and the case count has remained low (da Costa et al., 2020) . After these two rather limited outbreaks, SARS-CoV-2 has surprised the world again with the high transmissibility of the pathogen.

The period between November 2012 and July 2013 marked the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) that killed around 775 people in 2003. 1 Recently, a new strain of coronavirus, novel coronavirus (London1 novel CoV), has been reported worldwide. This virus has killed 18 people and more than 30 confirmed cases have been reported by the World Health Organization since September 2012. A majority of these cases have been reported from the Middle East; and of the 24 cases reported from Saudi Arabia, to date 15 have died. 2 The virus has travelled from Saudi Arabia to Europe, where new cases are being reported. Therefore, it has been placed by the experts in the list of viruses that pose a threat to cause epidemics and pandemics. 3 London1 novel CoV is a large RNA virus belonging to the same family as SARS, the Coronaviridae. This virus has more commonly been observed to cause diseases in people who have recently travelled to the Arabian Peninsula or its neighboring countries. Within 10 days, most cases have presented with fever (38 C or 100.4 F), cough, and shortness of breath, as well as lower respiratory tract symptoms such as severe acute pneumonia and renal failure, which may have a fatal outcome. The origin for this virus remains unknown and it is believed that person-to-person transmission can occur through airborne droplets and skin contact. 4 Travelers who have been to the Arabian Peninsula or its neighboring countries, their family members, and those who have been in close contact with them must be screened for the virus using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Currently, there is no particular treatment regimen or vaccine available for the illness, but recently a combination of two standard antiviral agents (ribavirin and interferon alpha 2b) has given good outcomes. Reduction of morbidity aims at isolating the patient and curtailing renal and respiratory tract symptoms. 2 Because not much data are available regarding novel CoV and experts suspect an upcoming pandemic, it has become a growing concern, especially for Hajj pilgrims. As there have been no travel restrictions to the Middle East, people travelling to and from there must be vigilant about their personal hygiene and should avoid contact with people suffering from respiratory symptoms. If they develop respiratory symptoms, medical assistance must be sought immediately. In countries such as Thailand, travelers returning from the Middle East are being screened for the fear of upcoming pandemics. Travelers from other Middle East countries must also be screened at their airports, particularly at the Hajj terminals as the Hajj season is approaching. Further research is required for a better understanding of this virus.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, pneumonia, and multi-organ failure. The infection spreads from one person to another via respiratory droplets. Alternative medicine (AMs) viz., Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani, and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are being promoted for the prevention of COVID-19. The aim of this systematic scoping review was to identify and summarize the scientific evidences promoting the use of AMs for the prevention of COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic search engines (PubMed and Web of Science) was performed. In addition, freewheeling searches of the government health ministries and government websites was done to retrieve the available information. Records available until 12th March 2020 were considered. Reports proposing the use of AMs for prevention or treatment of COVID-19 across all countries were included. Screening (primary and secondary) of the records and data extraction from the eligible studies were done by a single reviewer followed by a random quality check (10%) by the second reviewer. Results: Overall, 8 records (7 from China and 1 from India) exploring the use of AMs for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 were identified. Different medicines were explored by different AM systems. Conclusions: Several AMs options are proposed for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, their efficacy and safety still needs scientific validation through rigorous randomized controlled trials. This review may help inform decisions about the importance of research and development of AMs for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.

Coronavirus infections are endemic and ubiquitous in feline populations. Two viral types, type 1 and 2, are distinguished and both of them could well sustain themselves in the cat reservoir [15, 43] . Both have been shown to have worldwide distribution, with the seropositivity rate up to 90% among animal shelter populations and in multi-cat households [20, 44] . The majority of natural infections are caused by type 1 FCoVs, while in the field type 2 FCoVs are less common and mainly occur in Asia [15, 28, [45] [46] [47] . CoVs are generally considered to be host-specific; however, cross-species transmission does occur which may lead to incidental infections like the spillover of MERS-CoV from dromedary camel to humans, where humans function as an incidental and ultimately dead-end host [4] . But CoVs might also adapt to the new host exemplified by the animal origin of all four endemic human CoVs (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1) [8] [9] [10] [11] . Whereas in cats infections with FCoV are well recognized, studies regarding possible natural infections with other animal and human coronaviruses are lacking to the best of our knowledge. Knowing the genetic variability of coronaviruses and the use of orthologous receptors by non-feline CoVs, studies on cross-species transmission are desirable. This may provide insight regarding whether cross-species transmission does occur. In the present study we used the highly immunogenic S1 antigens to screen cat sera for the presence of antibodies against feline and non-feline coronaviruses, as a first indication of possible infections with these viruses.

Plague-transmitted by bites from an infected flea ; the disease spreads from human to human through contact with infected tissue and/or exposure to cough of an infected individual .	1. Plague-transmitted by bites from an infected flea; the disease spreads from human to human through contact with infected tissue and/or exposure to cough of an infected individual. This bacterial disease caused by Yersnia pestis killed millions of people in the Roman Empire and spread throughout Asia Minor and Greece as people moved away from infected areas running away from the disease. Another well-known outbreak of plague was "Black Death", which devastated Europe and Asia, killing almost a third of the population. Dhama et al. 2015; Na et al. 2015; Tartari et al. 2015; Van Kerkhove et al. 2015 ; WHO|One year into the Ebola epidemic: a deadly, tenacious and unforgiving virus, n.d.). Ebola is a viral disease transmitted through contact with body fluids, including the dead body of those who have died from the disease. There is currently no known cure for the disease although there are drugs that have been tested on some patients, some of whom have survived the infections. There are also individuals who have been able to build up immunity and survive the disease. Antibodies from these survivors hold information that could assist in further discoveries on the mechanism of disease. A vaccine has also been tried on some individuals who were in contact with Ebola patients, and these individuals were protected from the disease (Henao-Restrepo et al. 2015) . 3. Measles-This is one of the leading causes of death in young children. Caused by the measles virus, this infectious disease has also caused outbreaks in both adults and children despite the availability of a vaccine (Goodson et al. 2011; Nsubuga et al. 2006; Sniadack et al. 1999; WHO|Measles, n.d.) . Although active immunization occurs in developing countries, in some developed and developing countries the population is not immunized against the disease. This could be due to interruption of vaccination campaigns due to conflicts and breakdown in security and/or out of choice, as is the case of some developed countries where the vaccine is available but parents choose not to vaccinate their children against the disease. Spreading through droplets, from coughs and sneezes of infected individuals, the disease is highly infectious and mortality due to disease has been recorded worldwide. Approximately 1,45,700 deaths in 2013 were reported by WHO (Sniadack et al. 1999 ). 4. Malaria-Malaria is one of the highest causes of mortality in endemic areas with around 3.2 billion people (Approximately half of the world population) at risk of the disease. Since the year 2000, malaria mortality rates have reduced by 45 % globally and 49 % in Africa (WHO|World malaria report 2013 shows major progress in fight against malaria, calls for sustained financing, n.d.). Transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, the parasite from the genus Plasmodium is responsible for the disease. Plasmodium falciparum causes the most severe form of malaria (Beare et al. 2011; Boeuf et al. 2008; Milner et al. 2012; Montgomery et al. 2007; Roca-Feltrer et al. 2012) . P. falciparum is common in sub-Saharan Africa while P. vivax is common in Asia. Despite the availability of drugs that treat malaria, complications have risen due to development of resistance to the drugs by the parasite. This has led to change in the first-line drugs for treatment of malaria over the years. Since the 1950s drugs such as Chloroquine, Sulphoxine pyrimethamine (Fansidar), Lumefantrine artemether (LAR) and Artemisnin combination drugs are some of those that have been used as first-line drugs. Sadly the parasite has developed resistance to most of these drugs. The current malaria treatment uses Artemisnin combination therapy, which is recommended by WHO for treating uncomplicated malaria. It has been observed in the past decade that the parasite is developing resistance to Artemisnin in South-East Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam). Several methods for malaria prevention have been used including indoor residual spraying to kill the mosquito vector, sleeping under insecticide treated bed nets to prevent mosquito bites and destruction of mosquito habitats. Children under the age of 5 and pregnant women are at high risk (WHO|World malaria report 2013 shows major progress in fight against malaria, calls for sustained financing, n.d.). 5. Smallpox-Is one of the success stories in infectious diseases as it was declared eradicated by WHO in 1980. Smallpox was one of the most devastating diseases ever known. The last case diagnosed with smallpox was in 1977. The smallpox eradication programme, which ran from 1966 to 1980 was successful in identifying and following up on infected cases and finally in eradication of the disease. The viral disease caused by the Variola virus was highly contagious and was transmitted through droplets during close contact with an infected person. Eradication of smallpox is a success story in the infectious disease history. The efforts put together to contain the disease in the areas where it was endemic, active surveillance, vaccination and informative campaigns including following trails of the disease by "smallpox detectives" led to the eradication of the disease. The smallpox vaccine prevented infection and lessened the severity of the disease (WHO|Smallpox, n.d., WHO|The Smallpox Eradication Programme-SEP (1966 -1980 , n.d.). 6. Yellow fever-is spread by several species of the Aedes mosquito. Over 900 million people are at risk of yellow fever in endemic countries in Africa and Latin America. The disease has 50 % mortality in those with severe infections if untreated. The yellow fever vaccine is available and provides lifelong immunity. Despite the availability of the vaccine there has been an increase in cases of yellow fever in the past two decades. Human factors such as deforestation, urbanization, migration of people and lack of, and/or decline of immunity and climate change have contributed to the increase in cases (WHO|Yellow fever, n.d.). 7. Influenza-A viral disease spread through droplets in coughs and sneezes, influenza has caused several outbreaks including four major ones. These include the 1918 Spanish Influenza, which was followed 40 years later by the Asian Influenza pandemic of 1958, and 11 years later the 1969 Hong Kong Influenza outbreak and finally 40 years later in 2009 the Avian H1N1 influenza pandemic. Although a vaccine is available, it is only available on a yearly basis as the combinations of the strains to be included in the vaccine are determined by surveillance information collected each year. Influenza affects all ages worldwide (WHO|Influenza (Seasonal), n.d.). 8. Cholera-A dangerous infectious disease transmitted through water contaminated with faecal matter. Cholera is a bacterial disease caused by vibrio cholerae. Outbreaks are common in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa due to poor sanitation. Cholera can also be contracted from food that has come into contact with contaminated water, for example fruit and vegetables that have been washed with contaminated water. Characterized by the "rice water" diarrhoea, cholera can easily spread in communities resulting in local outbreaks especially during the rainy season in endemic regions. 9. Sleeping sickness (Trypanosomiasis)-Common in sub-Saharan Africa, trypanosomiasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by two vectors, tsetse flies for the African trypanosomiasis and triatomes (kissing bugs) for the American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). The parasite Trypanosoma brucei is responsible for the African sleeping sickness. Two species of the parasite are responsible for African sleeping sickness, T. b rhodesiense which causes acute infection and T. b gambiense which causes chronic disease. 10. HIV-The current HIV pandemic has resulted in approximately 1.5 million deaths in 2013 with approximately 35 million people infected globally. Sub-Saharan Africa carries the huge burden of the disease. Spread through body fluids, including sexual transmission, HIV has spread worldwide. About 3.2 million children were living with HIV in 2013. Mother to child transmission has resulted in children being infected with the virus at birth or during breast feeding. With no vaccine and/or cure at present abstinence and/or practicing safe sex through the use of condoms are the ways of preventing infection, being faithful to one partner is another way of preventing the spread of the disease if both partners are HIV negative. To suppress the HIV virus and/or stop the progression of the disease, anti-retro viral treatment is available for pregnant women, children born from HIV positive mothers and for people living with the virus (WHO|Use of antiretrovirals for treatment and prevention of HIV infection, n.d.). 11. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-An emerging viral disease that was first reported in Asia in 2003, SARS is caused by coronavirus. Spread through droplets the disease can rapidly spread within a country and across borders. People of all ages are at risk of the disease. There has been no other diagnosis of the disease since 2004. The disease is believed to have been of zoonotic origin. SARS is a good example of how infectious diseases can spread rapidly (Board 2013 ; WHO|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), n.d.). 12. Dengue haemorrhagic fever-A viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. The disease is endemic in the tropics and both children and adults are at high risk of contracting the disease. There is no treatment for the disease currently and the only way to prevent the spread of the disease is by controlling the mosquito vector. A vaccine against all four dengue serotypes has currently passed phase 3 trials (Villar et al. 2015) . Dengue is one of the neglected tropical diseases in the world causing over 390 million dengue infections every year with 128 countries at risk of the disease. Dengue fever is present in the Americas, South-East Asia and the Pacific with recent outbreaks occurring in Europe (France and Croatia in 2010, Portugal in 2012) and the United States (Florida in 2013). The threat of the disease is increasing and it is a global threat. With the climate change that is being experienced globally vectors are now able to reach and survive in areas that they have never been reported before (Aubry et al. 2012; Brady et al. 2012; WHO|Dengue, n.d.) .

Based on the development characteristics and viral structure of this health emergency, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it as COVID-19 1 , which is the seventh member of the human-infected coronavirus family 2, and two other notable family members are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, which have caused significant public health hazards. The paper 2 confirmed that COVID-19 can be transmitted from people to people through droplets or contact, or through the fecal-oral route, with a high incidence and rapid infection, posing a huge threat to global public health. COVID-19 is spreading around the world. The coronavirus outbreak in the world has seriously affected the quality of life.

While the most common symptoms of COVID-19 at the onset of illness include fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnea, other less common symptoms are headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting (10) . Furthermore, it's been recently reported that most patients also complain of impairment of both olfactory and gustatory perception (11) and those are being considered early markers of COVID-19 infection. Though there is longstanding evidence that human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, can spread to the brain from the respiratory tract (5, 12, 13) , the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (14) suggests that the gastrointestinal system is a possible route of invasion and transmission to the enteric nervous system (ENS) (see Figure 1) . While the effects of COVID-2019 on olfactory and gustatory perception may be transient, the possibility that viruses and other contaminant agents can be the initiating etiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) has been raised before (16) .

Coronavirus is an RNA virus known to be associated with respiratory disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized coronavirus whose genome sequence does not belong to any of the known coronavirus groups and which quickly spread all over the world from Asia in 2003. There has been no evidence that this infection is transmitted from blood donors to transfusion recipients, but the virus associated with SARS is present in the blood of people who are sick, and it is possible that the virus could be present in blood immediately before a person gets sick, so that an individual with infection but no symptoms possibly could transmit SARS through a blood donation. To help determine whether or not an individual might be infected with SARS, a blood collection facility will ask a potential donor orally or in writing about any travel to a SARS-affected country or a history of SARS or possible exposure to SARS. Enzyme-linked immunoassays for detection of speci fi c IgG and IgM antibodies and RT-PCR for detection of SARS coronavirus speci fi c RNA in the SARS patients has been developed. Rapid, sensitive, and speci fi c identi fi cation of SARS and other novel coronaviruses by molecular methods will be very important in the future.

Over 2,000 pilgrims travel from Singapore to Saudi Arabia on Hajj every year. In October 2012, over 600 were scheduled to embark on this journey. With the introduction of SARS by a handful of returning travelers fresh in our collective memory, we braced ourselves and primed our system for a possible outbreak, which thankfully did not occur. Concerns that this emerging pathogen would spread via the Hajj proved unfounded; this annual mass gathering of over 2 million Muslim pilgrims did not result in a global MERS CoV pandemic. Gautret et al. screened 150 of their returning Hajj pilgrims, 40 % of whom had influenza-like illness, the so-called "Hajj cough", but found no evidence of MERS CoV infection [10] .

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV-2 has shown once again that coronaviruses (CoVs) in animals are potential sources for epidemics in humans. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogen of swine with a worldwide distribution. Here, we implemented and described an approach to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV following its emergence in the pig population. We performed an integrated analysis of full genome sequence data from 21 newly-sequenced viruses, along with comprehensive epidemiological surveillance data collected globally over the last 15 years. We found four distinct phylogenetic lineages of PDCoV, which differ in their geographic circulation patterns. Interestingly, we identified more frequent intra- and inter-lineage recombination and higher virus genetic diversity in the Chinese lineages compared with the US lineage where pigs are raised in different farming systems and ecological environments. Most recombination breakpoints are located in the ORF1ab gene rather than in genes encoding structural proteins. We also identified five amino acids under positive selection in the spike protein suggesting a role for adaptive evolution. According to structural mapping, three positively selected sites are located in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, which is the most likely involved in binding to a carbohydrate receptor, while the other two are located in or near the fusion peptide of the S2 subunit and thus might affect membrane fusion. Finally, our phylogeographic investigations highlighted notable South-North transmission as well as frequent long-distance dispersal events in China that could implicate human-mediated transmission. Our findings provide new insights into the evolution and dispersal of PDCoV that contribute to our understanding of the critical factors involved in coronaviruses emergence. SIGNIFICANCE: Coronaviruses (CoVs) exhibit a pronounced propensity for interspecies transmission as illustrated by important emerging viruses in humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS)-CoV, as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 that is causing a major human pandemic. A better understanding of the evolutionary process leading to viral emergence may help unravel the principles of cross-species transmission and therefore assist in preventing future introductions into new host populations. Here, we examined the evolution and spread of an emerging coronavirus that likely transmitted from birds to pigs and caused sustained epidemics in Asia and the United States. We integrated viral full genome sequence analysis and comprehensive surveillance data to examine the evolution of emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and in particular the factors driving ongoing circulation and recent cases in China. We found evidence for adaptive evolution of this emerging virus in the absence of vaccine immune pressure, with important amino acids under positive selection, as well as frequent inter- and intra-lineage recombination events in the Asian lineages. Breeding patterns and ecological environment could play an important role in swine coronavirus evolution, leading to differences in recombination and population diversity. Using phylogeographic approaches, we further shed light on the dispersal history and dynamics of the China lineage of PDCoV. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geographic dispersal of genetic lineages of PDCoV in China and suggests that southern China acted as a source of transmission. Modeling how the virus spread in China will allow the prioritization of areas for swine coronavirus surveillance in the future. These findings have important implications for preventing the emergence of coronaviruses in livestock and for controlling their spread in Asian countries.

The ongoing outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans. 2019-nCoV rapidly spread to national regions and multiple other countries, thus, pose a serious threat to public health. Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.

The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) outbreak has engulfed an unprepared world amidst a festive season. The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment.

To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated COVID-19-associated knowledge, attitudes and practices among Pakistani university students and staff. COVID-19 is neither an air-borne nor water-borne disease; it spreads from infected individuals to others through respiratory droplets while sneezing or coughing, and through contaminated hands. The incubation period has been reported to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4-7) [12] , however the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests it can range from 2 to 14 days [13] . The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with one-third of patients experiencing dyspnoea [7, 8] . Other symptoms include myalgia, headache, sore throat, and diarrhoea [8] . Moreover, the elderly, patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease and chronic respiratory diseases) and healthcare professionals are at greater risk of COVID-19 [8, 14] . In our study, most participants knew the mode of transmission of COVID-19, 55.3% were aware of its incubation period, 93.7% knew the common symptoms, and 72% were aware of high-risk individuals. To date, management of COVID-19 has been largely supportive. Several drugs approved for other indications (e.g. chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, sofosbovir, ribavirin, etc.) and some investigational drugs (e.g. remdesivir, favipiravir) are being investigated to prevent or treat COVID-19 [15] . Surprisingly, ≈ 33% and 54% of study participants were unaware that there was no vaccine and any approved cure for COVID-19, respectively. Overall, it was encouraging to see that the majority of university students and employees had good COVID-19 knowledge and attitudes. This might be because our sample comprised staff and students belonging to the medical, pharmacy and allied health sciences fields of education. Similar studies conducted in China, Jordan and Saudi Arabia reported better knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 in university students [16] [17] [18] than were reported in our study in Pakistan.

The epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa that began in 2013 was the world's 25th known outbreak of the disease, dwarfing, in numbers of cases, the previous 24 combined. Transmitted from person to person, more than 28,000 people were ultimately infected, and more than 11,000 were killed, with the bulk of the cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. 1 As local health care systems struggled to respond to the large number of infected patients, health care providers from the United States and other countries responded to the outbreak in Africa through multiple aid organizations. These heroic individuals were faced with providing care to very ill patients with limited clinical resources. The hysteria over EVD in the media and among the state and local agencies responsible for making decisions regarding the monitoring and quarantine of returning health care workers were reminiscent of challenges encountered in the early days of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) crisis of the 1980s. 2 The media was concurrently attempting to cover the unprecedented outbreak while sharing public policy on the situation throughout the events. 3 In the fall of 2014, a patient who had recently traveled from West Africa was treated at a hospital in the United States. The patient was eventually confirmed to have EVD, ultimately resulting in 2 nurses who had direct contact with the patient also acquiring the illness. 4 EVD is a viral illness with some overlapping symptoms of other common and travel-related illnesses, so educating the public became critical to prevent panic and public concern regarding transmission of the virus (Fig. 1) .

Coronaviruses are revealed to target the human respiratory system mainly. However, they also have neuro-invasive abilities and might spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system. Herein, we report four patients with COVID-19 simultaneously diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. There were four stroke cases with simultaneously diagnosis of Covid-19 till the April 14, 2020 in the city of Sakarya, Turkey. They were aged between 45 to 77 years. All four cases were likely to have contracted the virus in Sakarya. The patients had all commonly reported symptoms of Covid-19. Three patients have elevated D-dimer levels, and two of them had high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. They were managed symptomatically for both the infection and the stroke. Our findings suggest that ischemic cerebrovascular diseases may simultaneously develop in the course of Covid-19 independently of the critical disease process. Increased inflammation predicted by CRP and D-dimer levels may play a role in the formation of ischemia. In particular, elder patients with prothrombotic risk factors should also be considered for the signs of cerebrovascular events in addition to infectious symptoms.

The novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in December 2019 [1] . Approximately 2.4 million cases have been reported up to date, including approximately 83.000 confirmed cases in Turkey [2] . The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and fatigue, as well as hemoptysis, and dyspnea. In severe cases, patients develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac problems, and multiple organ failure [4] . Besides, they also have neuro-invasive abilities and might spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system [3, 4] . It was recently shown that some patients with COVID-19 have neurological symptoms, such as headache, anosmia, dysgesia, dizziness, and impaired consciousness [4, 5] . COVID-19 may also predispose cerebrovascular diseases due to excessive inflammation, immobilization, hypoxia, and diffuse intravascular coagulation [6] . In this case report, 4 patients with COVID-19 were reported to be simultaneously accompanied by neurological involvement of acute ischemic stroke independently of the critical disease process. Although the pathophysiology of the neurological signs caused by COVID-19 have not been investigated in a detailed manner, the spectrum and intensities of these manifestations need to be explored.

The Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), reservoir host of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), carries many bat SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) with high genetic diversity, particularly in the spike gene. Despite these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins drives diversity. Here, we have identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiency in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS- and SARSr-CoV spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular evolution analysis indicates that these residues were under strong positive selection. These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics. It further proves that R. sinicus is the natural host of SARSr-CoVs. Importance Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously, we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These ACE2 variants support SARS- and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinity to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity of spillover to humans. The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike protein suggests a long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the prevention of the next SARS-like disease.

MERS-CoV binds to CD26 (DPP4) receptor for host cell entry and CD26 is also receptor for bat coronavirus HKU4 [11, 15] . Bat is a refractory of many coronavirus strains and a particular strain closely related to MERS-CoV transmitted to an animal species and then over time through small genetic changes in S, became capable of infecting human. Receptor for Covid-19 hasn't been identified yet, however the structure of the spike protein of the virus showed that it has a unsual furin-like clevage site that is not present on the surface of SARS or MERS [5] . Covid-19 is an unrelated coronoavirus that may have jumped multiple species and later a mutated version was able to infect human against which there is no immune protection. This suggests that other undiscovered coronaviruses circulating in wild bats or other animals can potentially infect humans that may spread faster from one person to another and lead to an outbreak.

It has since spread to 210 countries and territories, infecting 1,697,356 people and causing 102,667 deaths as of April 11, 2020 [1]. Compared to the previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 has caused more infections and deaths, spreading from an infected person to 2-2.5 people on average [2]. Most countries started reporting infections by the second half of January 2020.

Singapore reported its first case on January 23, 2020 [5]. In an effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, multiple interventions have been implemented on both societal and health care system levels [6], and the country shifted rapidly to Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) orange, the second-highest level of alert for disease outbreaks in Singapore, on February 7, 2020 [7], just 15 days after the first case of COVID-19 infection was confirmed.

Coronavirus is a large family of viruses with a variety of hosts. Some types of coronavirus circulate in humans and result in mild illness such as the common cold. Other members of the coronavirus family have zoonotic origins and cause severe illness when contracted by humans. Examples of zoonotic coronavirus types causing severe illness in humans are severe acute respiratory syndrome −associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) transmitted from civet cats, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmitted from dromedary camels. There are several other strains of coronavirus known in animals that have not yet been reported to have infected any humans. COVID-19 is spread from person to person through droplets, 2 and there are indications it may also be airborne. 3, 4 The current world outbreak of COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus that emerged in 2019 called SARS-CoV-2. 5 Although patient zero has not been determined, 9 cases of COVID-19 are now suspected of having come to medical attention in Wuhan, China, in November 2019. The number of cases increased rapidly, reaching 27 suspected cases by December 15 and 60 by December 20, 2019. 6 Current estimates are the number of infected persons worldwide doubles every 2 to 3 days. 7 As of March 25, 2020, there were 438,749 confirmed cases and 19,675 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 throughout the world. COVID-19 has been reported in 172 countries as of March 25, 2020. At the time, the overall death rate in the world was 4.48% but ranged from 9.85% in Italy to 0.51% in Germany and 1.23% in the United States.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, several epidemics have demonstrated the apparent ease with which these viruses can transfer from one species to another; along with these mutations comes an increase in the virulence of these new strains. The 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease, now referenced by the WHO as COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus officially named SARS-CoV-2. It is believed to have initially infected animals and was subsequently transmitted to humans, thus, enabling human to human transmission [3] . Being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has the inherent capacity of a high mutation rate that can make predicting the number of people infected as well as its future virulence virtually impossible.

Second, residue 501 in 2019-nCoV RBD (corresponding to residue 487 in SARS-CoV) is an asparagine (Fig. 1B and D) . Based on our previous structural analysis, residue 487 in SARS-CoV is located near virus-binding hot spot Lys353 (i.e., hot spot 353) on human ACE2 (Fig. 1C) (26) . Hot spot 353 consists of a salt bridge between Lys353 and Asp38 also buried in a hydrophobic environment. In civet SARS-CoV RBD (year 2002), residue 487 is a serine, which cannot provide favorable support for hot spot 353. In human SARS-CoV isolated in year 2002, residue 487 is a threonine, which strengthens the structural stability of hot spot 353. The S487T mutation adds the favorable interaction at the RBD-human ACE2 interface, enhances viral binding to human ACE2, and plays a critical role in the human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV (24) (25) (26) . In human SARS-CoV isolated in year 2003, residue 487 is a serine and there was no human-tohuman transmission for this SARS-CoV strain.

CoVid19 has many similarities with these 1918 flu and 2003 SARS. All are viral and contagious infections, epidemic in nature, turning into pandemic within few weeks, transmitted through droplets and very easily transmissible from human to human. It is also suspected that coronavirus can be transmitted through air and it can survive in environment without any decrease in its efficiency for a long time and thus the chance of infection increases [13] . If coronavirus is transmissible and airborne, this is an alarming situation for India. Normally during season change, Indians suffer from different common ailments like cold and cough, nasal congestion, conjunctivitis etc. Many of these diseases are infectious and transmissible. A large part of the population suffers from one or more of these issues commonly. Along with those common epidemics, CoVid19 has to be taken care of. Due to nor'westers during March/April the chances of fast spreading of CoVid19 is also high. Many people are already infected, among which all are not having significant symptoms and hence not identified. Finding ways to stop community transmission, case identification at initial stage and controlling the death rate is an emergency. Even the cure will not be easy to save the world if the infection is not prevented. Faster and easier worldwide transportation system has turned into a curse in case of viral epidemics. Due to international travels, almost all the countries in the world have got infected by this transmissible virus within a very short duration simultaneously. CoVid19 has affected 209 Countries and Territories around the world as of 8th April 2020. From the information of the impact of 1918 pandemic in India, we have tried to understand the underlying facts. A large population who lived near and below poverty line got affected by the 1918 pandemic [14] . Apparently, it seems that, the sanitation had a significant relation with the disease infection, spread and severity. But the high mortality rate in case of CoVid19 even in developed countries raises a question on this easy assumption. Light from a different angle may have some answer to it.

This study estimated the force of infection (FOI) of MERS-CoV in camel populations from age-stratified serological data. A cross-sectional study of MERS-CoV was conducted in Kenya from July 2016 to July 2017. Seroprevalence was stratified into four age groups: <1, 1–2, 2–3 and >3 years old. Age-independent and age-dependent linear and quadratic generalised linear models were used to estimate FOI in pastoral and ranching camel herds. Models were compared based on computed AIC values. Among pastoral herds, the age-dependent quadratic FOI was the best fit model, while the age-independent FOI was the best fit for the ranching herd data. FOI provides an indirect estimate of infection risk, which is especially valuable where direct estimates of incidence and other measures of infection are challenging to obtain. The FOIs estimated in this study provide important insight about MERS-CoV dynamics in the reservoir species, and contribute to our understanding of the zoonotic risks of this important public health threat.

Infection with MERS-CoV, in its initial description, resembled "SARS-like" illness (Chan et al., 2015a,b) . Further analysis of the epidemiological, virological, and clinical aspects of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed important differences between the two viruses. Identifying unique aspects of MERS-CoV helped to explain how the epidemic evolved and the steps that could be taken to prevent its spread (Chan et al., 2015a,b) . Serological studies have indicated that most dromedary camels in Africa and the Middle East, but not other animals such as sheep, goats, and cows, were seropositive for MERS-CoV . Moreover, seroprevalence in dromedary camels appears to vary, with high rates reported in animals from Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Sudan and lower rates in animals from Tunisia (Ali et al., 2017) . Intriguingly, dromedaries from Australia, Canada, the United States, Germany, Netherlands, and Japan have been reported to be seronegative for MERS-CoV (Omrani et al., 2015) . Importantly, population-based seroepidemiologic studies indicated that the seroprevalence of the virus was several folds higher in people who have been exposed to camels compared to those in the general population ( Accumulating serologic and molecular evidence indicates that the virus in dromedaries is genetically similar to MERS-CoV in humans, supporting the notion that dromedary camels could be the potential source of infection to human Memish et al., 2014a,b,c; Sabir et al., 2015) . Indeed, MERS-CoV antibodies have been isolated in dromedary camels across the Arabian peninsula, North Africa, and Eastern Africa dating from as far back as the 1990s (Milne-Price et al., 2014; Omrani et al., 2015) . This finding suggests that MERS-CoV may have been circulating in dromedaries for over 20 years before it was first recognized as a cause of human infection (Aly et al., 2017) . In a recent study, a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection was reported in an individual who had direct contact with a dromedary camel (Azhar et al., 2014) . Sequence analysis of the virus isolated from the case and the camel was identical, clearly indicating that MERS-CoV can indeed be transmitted from camels to human (Azhar et al., 2014) . It appears that active infection with release of the virus in nasal secretions, particularly during the incubation period, is important for the transmission of the virus to humans . Where and how the camels acquired the infection remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that bats could be the potential source (Fig. 8.3 ) (Anthony et al., 2017; Mohd et al., 2016; Omrani et al., 2015) . Indeed, MERS-CoV-like viruses have been identified in certain species of bats (Anthony et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2006) . The bats are present in most parts of the world and often infected with various zoonotic viruses. Thus it is plausible that at some point in the past, camels acquired the infection from bats, leading to a sustained infection in the camel population (Fig. 8.3) . MERS-CoV RNA has been identified in the milk, nasal secretion, and feces of dromedary camels (Omrani et al., 2015) . Since camels and humans are often in close contact, particularly in the Arab Gulf States, humans would be at increased risk of contracting the virus from actively infected animals (Mackay and Arden, 2015; Reusken et al., 2015) . Indeed, MERS-CoV seropositivity in shepherds and those working in slaughterhouses in Saudi Arabia has been reported to be an order of magnitude higher than in the general population (Arabi et al., 2017) . Although possible, no evidence currently exists to support the transmission of MERS-CoV from bats to humans directly. What is certain is that transmission of the virus can occur from camels to humans, but the process is still not fully understood (Al Hammadi et al., 2015; Memish et al., 2014a,b,c) . One possibility is that some species of CoVs from camels and humans could recombine leading to the emergence of a new virus that can infect both, camels and human (Sabir et al., 2015) .

During the recent severe acute respiratory (SARS) outbreak, the etiologic agent was identified as a new coronavirus (CoV). We have isolated a SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV) strain by injecting Vero cells with a sputum specimen from an Italian patient affected by a severe pneumonia; the patient traveled from Vietnam to Italy in March 2003. Ultrastructural analysis of infected Vero cells showed the virions within cell vesicles and around the cell membrane. The full-length viral genome sequence was similar to those derived from the Hong-Kong Hotel M isolate. By using both real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction TaqMan assay and an infectivity plaque assay, we determined that approximately 360 viral genomes were required to generate a PFU. In addition, heparin (100 μg/mL) inhibited infection of Vero cells by 50%. Overall, the molecular and biologic characteristics of the strain HSR1 provide evidence that SARS-CoV forms a fourth genetic coronavirus group with distinct genomic and biologic features.

BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan City, China, at the end of 2019 and has caused an outbreak of human-to-human transmission with a Public Health Emergency of International Concern declared by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. AIM: We aimed to estimate the potential risk and geographic range of Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread within and beyond China from January through to April, 2020. METHODS: A series of domestic and international travel network-based connectivity and risk analyses were performed, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. RESULTS: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 – 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to Wuhan’s lockdown. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. CONCLUSION: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.

The majority (89.0%) of the respondents reported that information about MERS-CoV was received from the internet, followed by the SMS (23.9%). Few participants reported that they received information from other sources, such as television, healthcare workers, family members, magazines or books (18.7%, 15.5%, 12.6%, 11.0%, and 8.3%, respectively). No significant differences were found in the sources of information between respondents with a good or poor level of knowledge on MERS-CoV in this cohort of participants (Table 2) . Table 3 shows the frequencies of correct responses to each question in the epidemiological and clinical domains. Almost all of the participants had heard of the coronavirus disease and were able to relate its cause to a viral origin (100% and 99%, respectively). The participants also highly recognized the mode of transmission of the disease as via the respiratory tract through coughing (99.0%) and from person to person (94.4%). However, they were less likely to associate the transmission of infection with talking with an infected person or to shaking hands with an infected person (52.4% and 49.3%, respectively). Frequencies of correct answers to questions related to whether the virus could be transmitted from an animal to a person, whether the camel was a reservoir of the causative agent, whether the agent could cause repeated infections and whether they knew of any vaccine against the agent were 86.4%, 84.8%, 66.3%, and 75.1%, respectively. Knowledge about signs and symptoms, such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, pharyngitis and diarrhea, was high (97%). Questions such as "Could MERS-CoV lead to direct death" also showed a high rate of positive answers (89.5%). However, the participants' knowledge about other questions related to the incubation period of the disease, the recovery of patients and infection without signs and symptoms was poor (59.2%, 25.0%, and 24.1%, respectively).

Sixth, communication with the fever clinic should be strengthened. The living history of the areas with COVID-19 outbreaks and the contact history of confirmed COVID-19 patients are important evidence for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The doctors in the fever clinic can conduct preliminary screening of the patients by tracing the contact history and the exposure history of patients in areas with COVID-19 outbreaks and can determine each patient's degree of suspicion. Patients with suspected COVID-19 infection should be guided and carefully transferred from the fever clinic to the medical imaging department through the fast track for examination to reduce their movement range and avoid transmission to others. After the patients are examined, they should be guided back to the isolation area of the fever clinic immediately to reduce their time in the closed environment and avoid cross-infection among patients during the examination.

Another intriguing fi nding of our study was the difference in the amplifi cation pattern of the RNA viruses and that of the DNA virus. We selected these viruses because, in humans, AdVs are typically capable of persisting in tissue (34) and thus do not depend so much on continuous transmission and consistent amplifi cation on the population level. Indeed, it appeared that AdV did not make use of periodic amplifi cation in our bat colony. Persistence on the level of individual bats is more common for DNA viruses than for RNA viruses. RNA viruses ensure that they are maintained on a population level by a much higher error rate of the enzymes they use for genome replication and consequent higher levels of antigenic variability, causing waves of epidemic spread as confi rmed for bat-borne RNA viruses in this study. This factor can explain why most emerging viruses, including those from bats, are indeed RNA viruses (2, 35) . For CoV, our study indicates clearly that virus amplifi cation takes place in maternity colonies, confi rming our earlier statistical implications from studies in a different region and on a different species (16) . High peak RNA concentrations in the range of 10 9 -10 10 copies/g were observed, which is tremendously higher than CoV concentrations observed in earlier studies outside the parturition period (19) . Similarly high RNA virus concentrations are observed in human diseases transmitted through the fecal-oral route, e.g., picornaviruses or noroviruses, which suggests that maternity roosts may involve an elevated risk of virus transmission to other hosts. It is interesting to reconsider the potential genesis of the SARS epidemic in this light. Although an origin of SARS-related CoV in bats is confi rmed (9, 36) , SARS-CoV precursors have existed in carnivores some time before the SARS epidemic and have been transmitted from carnivores to humans again at least one additional time after the end of the epidemic (37, 38) . these data provide an intriguing explanation of how the SARS agent may have left its original reservoir (39, 40) . The data also indicate a feasible and ecologically sensible means of prevention. Because carnivores are known to enter maternity roosts to feed on dead newborn bats, bat maternity roosts should be left undisturbed by humans and kept inaccessible to domestic cats and dogs.

The COVID-19 virus was detected at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, central China. With the migration of population, the virus was spread rapidly from Wuhan to all provinces of China. At the end of February 2020 infectious cases were found in Italy, and in April 2020 several cases have been detected in almost all the world. This virus can cause serious acute respiratory syndrome, that sometimes can be exacerbate by air pollution, that is a well-known source of pulmonary diseases (Petrosillo et al., 2020) . Northern Italy suffers of severe and persistent environmental issues due to air pollution, that is mainly attributed to high density of population and the related anthropogenic activities (Caserini, P et al., 2017) . The Northern Italian territory is composed by a basin valley (the Po Valley) characterized by low wind speeds and a stable atmosphere, where urban and industrial centres lie. Geophysical and microclimatic characteristics of Po valley, which is surrounded by the Alps, makes it harder the emissions to be dissolved. As a consequence, also the atmospheric stagnant conditions, happening on the basin valley, contribute to the accumulation of PM in the lower troposphere (Ferrero et al., 2019) . The air pollution in Northern Italy is also influenced by long-range transport (Squizzato, et al., 2016) , with the consequence that almost all the area suffers of very similar pollution conditions. Very recent literature, and several newspapers articles published in March 2020 have suggested that the expansion of COVID-19 in Northern Italy, and in particular in Lombardy (for example in Brescia and Bergamo) was promoted by airborne particulate matter (PM) high concentration, with the idea that atmospheric particulate acts as a virus carrier (Sterpetti 2020) . This debate, concerning the virus possible airborne transmission mechanism, is based on the Italy and China situations concerning air pollution. Indeed, the China air pollution phenomena is well-documented (Sun et al., 2017) , and the Lombardy situation was compared to Wuhan (Hubei region), due to the PM high concentrations that generally occur, mainly in winter, in the Po valley (Perrino et al., 2014) . PM identify fine particles, that are a mixture of several chemical compounds, that can have both primary and secondary origin (Borgese et al, 2012) : primary particulate matter is directly emitted from sources, while secondary PM is originated from complex chemical reactions and physical processes involving emissions of precursor gases (Gualtieri et al, 2018) (Zanoletti et al., 2020) . In urban areas, several anthropogenic sources contribute to PM generation, such as domestic heating, road transport (Genc et al., 2010) , and industrial activities (Borgese et al. 2013 ) (Zacco et al., 2009) with an increased contribution, in recent years, due to domestic heating of biomass burning (Viana et al., 2013) . Some authors also reported that natural sources may have a significant contribution to airborne PM, as for example desert dust and sea salts (Diapouli et al. 2017 ) (Bontempi et al., 2008 . From a sanitary point of view, PM has been related to health effects: several studies found a relationship between the PM concentration and the increase of several diseases (Lanzinger et al., 2016) . To preserve the people health from PM pollution, in EU the Directive 2008/50/EC defined the daily limit of 50 μg/m 3 for PM 10 (PM 10 is defined as particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm), not to be exceeded more than 35 days per year (Directive 2008/50/EC). There are only few data in literature concerning epidemic phenomena and their possible correlation with air particulate matter amount and diffusion. A recent paper about PM characterization showed that the majority of the inhalable microorganisms found in PM (also including fungi, bacteria, and dsDNA viruses) were soil-associated and non-pathogenic to human (Cao et al., 2014,) . In the cases of virus infection, severe air pollution, with peaks of PM concentration, can produce negative effects. For example, infected people can be more susceptible to disease, due to a reduced body immunity, making microorganisms more invasive (Yang et al., 2020) . In this frame, a recent published work, based on a study realised in Lombardy, reports that PM concentration influences the immune system, with the consequence to foster the spread of some virus infection (Carugno et al., 2018) . However, this is a different mechanism of PM incidence of virus on the human health, in comparison to the investigated one, i.e. the possible air transport of virus. In the present case the concern is the survival of disease-causing microorganisms in the ambient air environment and, more precisely, their transport by means of airborne particulate matter (airborne transmission). In this context, it is important to highlight that while the chemical composition of PM (Bilo et al., 2017) and its impacts on human health have been widely investigated (Ramli et al., 2020) , the potential effect of airborne virus exposure (due to PM) remains unclear. In particular, although the characterizations of bioaerosol have reported the presence of viruses in air, the highly diluted nature of viral bioaerosols has been a major impediment to viral aerobiological research, as for example the study of viral interactions with PM particles. A very recent paper, investigating the role of PM, highlight that the "presence" of DNA signatures, that may be associated with potential pathogens presence, should be considered as only exploratory evidence of potential risks (Qin et al. 2020) . World Health Organization asserts that COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Airborne transmission is currently considered possible in specific circumstances, such as procedures that generate aerosols (WHO, Scientific brief 2020). Then, the question is if PM can act in two ways: it is already recognized as a chronic stress factor that makes the population more vulnerable to an epidemic. However, concerning the recent proposed possibility that PM acts as a vehicle, then revealing that it allows the COVID-19 virus carried through the air, this is the actual debate.

Two different genera of the virus family Orthomyxoviridae, influenza A and B, can cause a contagious respiratory disease in humans. They cause annual epidemics of varying severity, including mild common cold symptoms to severe lung injury with fatal outcome. IAVs, on which we focus in this review, show a very wide variety and thus are further subgrouped by the antigenic properties of their surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Besides the well-defined strains circulating in humans (of the subgroups H1N1 and H3N2), IAVs are present in a large number of mammalian species, poultry, and particularly wild birds, with currently 18 or 11 variants known for HA or NA, respectively, where the recently discovered bat-isolates H17/18 and N10/11 seem to be quite distinct from avian and mammalian strains. 5, 6 Influenza virus epidemics usually occur during the cold season in temperate regions (Northern hemisphere: December to April; Southern hemisphere: June to September) when low humidity and temperature ambient conditions are suggested to prolong virus shedding and transmission. 7 In subtropical and tropical regions, influenza seasons are less clearly defined, allowing recurrent infections all over the year. Thus-and due to other reasons such as close proximity to domestic poultry-it has been proposed that the Asian continent represents a particular "reservoir" for not only endemic human but also zoonotic influenza virus strains. 8, 9 Overall, seasonal IAV affects up to 10% of the adult population and 20% of children annually 10 and displays a substantial morbidity. A cohort study estimates that between 2003 and 2009 in the United States, seasonal influenza was responsible for 3.8% of all admissions for respiratory failure and evaluates the incidence of influenza-associated acute respiratory failure at 2.7 per 100,000 persons per year. 11 This results in considerable clinical and economic burden. For the United States, direct medical costs covering health care for influenza-induced illness as well as economic losses due to lost working days and declined production are proposed to account for at least 26 billion USD annually. 12 Compared with the seasonal influenza, pandemics have occurred every 20 to 30 years and are generally associated with more severe symptoms which also affect a healthy young population and potentially lead to increased mortality rates. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Pandemic IAV strains are newly introduced into an immunologically naive human population and usually derive from avian reservoirs and have reassorted in an intermediate host such as swine, where they acquire further adaptive mutations, enabling them to infect the human respiratory tract and to effectively transmit from human to human, causing a human disease 18, 19 (►Fig. 1).

The COVID-19 spread illustrates the role of MGs in exacerbation of the scope of pandemics. Anecdotal reports from the 1957 influenza pandemic suggested that influenza first emerged in Indochina and Malaysian pilgrims travelled with it to Mecca and transmitted to fellow pilgrims from the rest of the world. Respiratory diseases are the most common infections transmitted during MGs. [13] During the early phase of MG medicine, the most extensively reported epidemiological data on infectious diseases at MG emerged from the Hajj. The congestion of people during the Hajj promotes increased carrier rates of N meningitidis and transmission of respiratory viruses. Over the past decade, a significant number of publications from different countries based on both syndromic surveillance and PCR-based investigation of respiratory pathogen carriage at the Hajj and other MG were made available. Invasive meningococcal disease has been a Hajj-related public health concern with its last outbreaks (serogroup W-135) in the 2000s. However, since the introduction of mandatory vaccination, no case of meningococcal disease has been reported in Mecca since 2006. In November 2004, a Sudanese child was diagnosed with polio one day after arrival in Saudi Arabia. This case coincided with the diagnosis of another 104 cases in Sudan. In response, the Saudi ministry of health now stipulates requires proof of vaccination to obtain visas for entry to Saudi Arabia and supplementary vaccination is offered to pilgrims originating from (WHO determined) polio risk and endemic countries (Fig. 1) .

Mastitis, or infection of the mammary glands, is common, and occurs in 5-33% of breast feeding women. 111 Almost all cases appear in the first 3 months, and very rarely at weaning. In a small percentage, mastitis is complicated by breast abscess or recurrent mastitis. Risk factors for mastitis include older maternal age, fatigue, employment outside the home, trauma to the skin or nipple, ineffective nursing technique, and milk stasis. The presenting symptoms are chills, rigors, and fever, in conjunction with unilateral breast tenderness, erythema, and decreased milk production. Most mastitis is caused by S. aureus, which may be transmitted to the mother from an infant nasally colonized before hospital discharge, followed by streptococci and E. coli. Prevention includes proper positioning of the infant and nursing technique. Initial treatment includes an antistaphylococcal oral antibiotic such as dicloxacillin or cephalothin, after cultures of expressed milk have been obtained. If fever persists, coverage should be modified for activity against methicillinresistant S. aureus. Women should be treated for 10 days. If an abscess has formed it should be drained by ultrasoundguided needle aspiration, or surgically.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is mainly transmitted from person to person via respiratory droplets. COVID-19 pneumonia appears to be the most common serious manifestation of the disease. It is predominately characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [6, 7] . Atypical presentations of COVID-19 disease are frequent in hemodialysis patients and they are usually difficult to distinguish from other symptoms common among these patients. Wang et al. reported five cases of COVID-19 disease in hemodialysis patients in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. They found that only three out of five had a fever and that the typical triad of fever, cough, and dyspnea was not present in any of the patients reported [8] . In our case, the patient did not have any documented fever spikes on admission or during the hospital stay.

Lack of critical care resource in face of COVID-19 epidemics Based on data reported by the National Health Commission of China, there have been about 2000 new confirmed cases and?>?4000 suspected cases daily over the past week in Wuhan [3]. About 15% of the patients have developed severe pneumonia, and about 6% need noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support. Currently, there are about 1000 patients who need ventilatory support and another 120 new patients daily who require noninvasive or invasive ventilation support in Wuhan city; however, there are only about 600 ICU beds [4]. To address this shortfall, 70 ICU beds were created from general beds and the government quickly transformed three general hospitals to critical care hospitals with a total of about 2500 beds that specialize in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (equipped with monitors and high-flow nasal cannula, noninvasive ventilator or invasive ventilators). An equally great (or potentially greater) problem is the shortage of trained personnel to treat these critically ill patients. Until the crisis, there were about 300 ICU physicians and 1000 ICU nurses in Wuhan city. By the end of January, more than 600 additional ICU doctors and 1500 ICU nurses were transferred to Wuhan from the rest of China. As well, an additional 3000 staff including infectious disease, respiratory, internal medicine physicians and nurses were transferred to Wuhan by the government. There are logistical issues which make care of the patients difficult. These include donning of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, respiratory and eye protection), lack of instruments and disposables, and shortages of supplemental oxygen. Many severe hypoxemic patients only receive high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation rather than invasive mechanical ventilation because of intubation delay or lack of mechanical ventilators (especially at early phase). Our preliminary data show that only about 25% of patients who died were intubated and received mechanical ventilation.JO - Intensive Care Medicine

This first clinical report is useful for highlighting some key issues surrounding both the emergence and the management of the 2019-nCoV that are currently being investigated by experts worldwide. The first is the search for a reservoir and/or an intermediate host from which the infection spread to humans. Two species of snakes have been proposed as the possible wildlife reservoir of the 2019-nCoV on the basis of the virus codon using pattern, 8 although other researchers remain sceptical, stating that there is no consisting evidence of coronavirus reservoirs other than mammals and birds, and indicating that mammals are the most likely link between 2019-nCoV and humans. 9 The fact that many (66%) but not all of the 41 clinical cases were exposed to the Huanan Seafood Market introduces another important issue, that is, the possibility of human-to-human transmission besides exposure to infected animals. A human-to-human transmission through virus-laden aerosols was confirmed for SARS-CoV. 10 With regard to 2019-nCoV, a similar possibility is in line with the fact that not all the reported cases were directly exposed to the Huanan Seafood market, and also with the observation that some cases occurred in healthcare workers. 6 In addition, the existence of a self-sustained human-to-human transmission is supported by the analyses of the Imperial College London, UK, conducted using a mathematical model of transmissibility. 7 Their most recent estimation (which will be likely updated and refined according to the future trajectory of the outbreak) is that each case infected on average 2.6 other people (uncertainty range 1.5-3.5), with the possibility of a self-sustaining human-to-human transmission being the only plausible explanation for the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan. They also estimated that blocking over 60% of transmission would be necessary for infection-control measures to effectively control the outbreak. 7 The question that remains is whether asymptomatic subjects incubating the infection and cases with relatively mild symptoms (those with an influenza-like syndrome neither necessitating nor searching for care) are able to effectively transmit the virus to other humans, since this may complicate or delay the effectiveness of infection-control measures. On the other hand, a large pool of mild cases could explain the currently reported low case fatality rate (2.2%) in press news, which is lower than the case fatality rate observed in the hospitalized patients with pneumonia described in the published report (15%), 2,6 which probably better represents the subpopulation of patients with the most severe clinical presentation rather than the entire population of 2019-nCoV-infected patients, in which the overall crude mortality is likely lower. Worth noting is also that the case fatality rate of 2019-nCoV reported in the press news is lower than those previously described for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (9.5% and 40%, respectively 11 ). Finally, the promising effect observed in animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections of antivirals such as remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir is guiding their evaluation against 2019-nCoV (a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir in hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection has been initiated in China). Clinical presentation Fever (98%), cough (76%) and dyspnoea (55%) were the most frequent signs and symptoms. 6 Diarrhoea observed only in 3% of patients. 6 Fever (99%-100%), cough (62%-100%), and chills or rigour (15%-73%) were the most frequent signs and symptoms. 11 Shortness of breath and diarrhoea observed in 40%-42% and 20%-25% of patients, respectively. 11

Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid (8.5 kDa) protein that can be covalently ligated to lysine residues of a target protein through its conserved C-terminal di-glycine motif (17) . Ubiquitination is a three-step enzymatic process involving three enzymes with distinct functions: E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligating (Figure 2A ). The first step is the formation of a thioester linkage between ubiquitin and the E1. In the next step, ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to the active-site cysteine of E2. Finally, E3 assists the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and a lysine residue of a target protein (18) (19) (20) (21) . Ubiquitin itself can be ubiquitinated and form polyubiquitin chains (polyubiquitination). Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) on which diverse chain types of polyubiquitin can be assembled (20) (Figure 2B ). In addition, ubiquitin chains can also be linked in a linear (M1) fashion by attachment of the C-terminal glycine of an ubiquitin to the N-terminal methionine of another ubiquitin, resulting in a head-to-tail polyubiquitination (22) (Figure 2B ). Different ubiquitin linkages fulfill different functions ( Figure 2B ). K48-and K63linked polyubiquitin chains are the best characterized. K48 linkage targets proteins for proteasomal degradation, whereas K63 and M1 linkages regulate intracellular immune signals (14-16, 23, 24) . The other linkage types are referred as "atypical" and have not been studied in much detail (25) . Each chain type has a different three-dimensional conformation that is recognized specifically by ubiquitin-binding proteins (UBPs). This recognition is essential for the transmission of intracellular signaling (26) (27) (28) . Recently, it has been reported that in addition to the above described covalently attached polyubiquitin chains, unanchored polyubiquitin chains also contribute to the activation of intracellular pathways leading to the onset of the antiviral response (29, 30) . Ubiquitination is reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs) that detach ubiquitin from the substrate (Figure 2A) . This usually leads to termination of immune signaling. In this way, ubiquitination/deubiquitination processes dynamically regulate the early innate immune response and prevent immune-mediated host damage (13) .

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected more than 8,000 people worldwide spreading over 30 countries across 5 continents in the 2002-2003 outbreak Peiris et al. 2003; Poon et al. 2004b ). This highly contagious infection claimed over 900 lives in a short period of time with a fatality rate of 9.6%, emerging as a huge global threat to human health. SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of SARS, which is believed to have transmitted from wild animals to the human population Wang et al. 2006 ). According to WHO, the absence of a rapid screening test delayed the diagnosis of suspected cases of SARS and resulted in the spread of the disease worldwide. Current methods for the confirmation of SARS infection include detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription-PCR (Jiang et al. 2004; Poon et al. 2004a; Yam et al. 2003) , detection of SARS-CoV antibodies in body fluids using indirect fluorescence assay , and isolation of SARS-CoV from clinical samples (Keyaerts et al. 2005; Yamashita et al. 2005) . Since viral culture is a time consuming, tedious, and insensitive method, PCR and antibody detection methods are widely used; however, these two methods are expensive, laborious, and require technical expertise . A simple, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic test for the specific and early detection of SARS-CoV is therefore extremely important to limit the spread of infection and for proper risk management in the case of a future global outbreak especially since SARS has high rates of transmission and mortality.

Coronaviruses are viruses that circulate among animals and are named because of the crownlike spikes (protein spikes) that protrude from their surface resembling the sun's corona. The first transmission of this type of virus from animals to humans happened in 2002 in the Guangdong province of China which resulted in SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Bats were thought to be the potential source of this virus. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) was identified in early January 2020 which was traced to the severe pneumonic outbreak of an undocumented cause in early December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. Similar to SARS, bats are seen as the potential source from which this virus has spread to humans. Due to rapid spread of the virus within a short time globally resulting in health emergencies in a number of countries, WHO declared this as a pandemic on 11 th March 2020. Initially the virus was named 2019-nCoV but later was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its "genetic relationship to the SARS-COV-1 virus"(Medscape, 2020) The entire human population is at potential risk as being a new virus nobody has prior immunity to it. There is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease and is highly transmissible. Epidemiological estimation at present is that on an average, one infected person will infect between two to three other people. The spread has been from respiratory droplets and from contaminated surfaces. The world is facing a common challenge; how to control the spread of and what can be the effective interventions to control mortality. The early examples from China suggested the most effective method to control the spread of the virus is through lockdowns and social distancing measures. The example of South Korea suggested testing as the major component of the mitigation measures. Some studies pointed out the importance of hand hygiene and face masks in controlling the virus. With new hotspots emerging, the number of new cases and those not able to recover are raising new concerns every day. Risk and uncertainty behind this disease control has generated a global concern for health, economy, and for persons at large. The alarming spread of the virus has shocked people across the world pushing among others researchers to understand the virus-its structure, transmission, replication mechanism, latency, etc. and promising interventions that can effectively control it. Extensive global efforts are undertaken to develop vaccine and drug. This is unsurprisingly leading to huge volume of research activity within a short period of time increasing at an exponential rate. As the recent editorial published in The Lancet highlights "The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been obtained and shared widely by mid-January, a feat not possible at such speed in previous infectious disease outbreaks" The editorial points out the importance of the need for development of effective diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine for the virus. Examining from the Dimensions database as of 22 April, it was found that 1633 clinical trials are being conducted on the virus and 171 policy documents have been published so far. The number of research papers, clinical trials at different phases within such a short period is unprecedented and shows the intensive efforts of the global research community to understand the different aspects of this disease and address it. Seven patents have also been granted. It is important to capture insights of influential research and innovation from this ongoing activity for policy makers and research scholars from cross-disciplinary areas to build up further on this valuable repository. Societal impact and what aspects are of concern to the people at large are difficult to capture. One useful method would be from online trends surrounding this disease that would indicate to some extent the key issues that are influencing the society at large. The present study is motivated by this and applies tools and techniques of scientometrics to uncover insights from research papers. Scientometrics applies various mathematical and statistical techniques to capture insights of research activity from research papers and patents and other published sources including online sources (Altmetrics) by constructing various types of indicators. Citation based analysis is a prominent method to capture academically significant and theoretically relevant material (see for example Glanzel, 2003) . Keeping in view the research activity in this area started primarily with the outbreak of this disease, impact captured through citations would not give a correct picture as citations takes time to accrue. This is true for research paper as well as patent citations. Citations that influence current research activity would however be useful to construct the present knowledge base. One of the useful method that can do so is based on cocitation analysis which captures frequency with which two documents are cited together (Small, 1973) . Co-Citation establishes an intellectual relationship with earlier literature in a field/subfield/area of research; strength of relationship based on frequency of co-citation pairs. The rise of social networking websites like twitter, Facebook etc. provides researchers a wider scope to share their scholarly publications. Altmetrics allows to track and capture online impact of scholarly research and thus broadly indicates papers that are influencing the research community. To put it in a proper perspective, one can borrow from William (2017), "Altmetrics are measurements of how people interact with a given scholarly work". Altmetrics or article level metrics according to Das and Mishra (2014) is a "new trendsetter" to measure "impact of scientific publication and their social outreach to intended audience". It reflects "a scholarly article's popularity, usage, acceptance and availability" by using an altmetric score. Google Trends which was launched in 2006, primarily shows how frequently a particular search term is entered in comparison with all other search terms in different regions and languages (Google, 2017). In Google trends level of interest in a topic is approximated using search volume of Google. Sullivan (2016) estimated searches on Google Trends reached 2 trillion in 2016! Thus, this is one of the most significant source of data if it is properly analysed. One of the most influential study was by Ginsberg et al. (2006) which showed that Google Trends traced and predicted the spread of influenza earlier than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Jun et al. (2018) provides a good assessment of research studies in the past decade which have utilized Google Trends. They highlight the diverse fields in which this has been used for, from merely describing and diagnosing research trends to forecasting changes. According to Mavragani et al. (2018) "Google Trends shows the changes in online interest for time series in any selected term in any country or region over a selected time period, for example, a specific year, several years, 3 weeks, 4 months, 30 days, 7 days, 4 hours, 1 hour, or a specified time-frame." They argue that as the internet penetration is increasing web based search activity has become a valid indicator of public behaviour. The paper positions itself in this direction; applying various tools and techniques of scientometrics, Altmetrics and Google Trends to draw meaning from the huge volume of research papers and online activity surrounding this pandemic. The study attempts to answer the following research questions:

MSAs in general have higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol with biomodal size distributions compared to PAA in both hospitals during the first batch of sampling in the peak of COVID-19 outbreak. For Renmin Hospital sampling sites, the air circulation in MSA by design is isolated from that of the patient rooms. While for Fangcang Hospital, the nonventilated temporary PARR has limited air penetration from the patient hall where the SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration was generally low. We believe one direct source of the high SARS-CoV-2 aerosol concentration may be the resuspension of virus-laden aerosol from the surface of medical staff protective apparel while they are being removed. These resuspended virus-laden aerosol originally may come from the direct deposition of respiratory droplets or virus-laden aerosol onto the protective apparel while medical staff having long working hours inside PAA, as shown from the SARS-CoV-2 deposition results in ICU room. Another possible source is the resuspension of floor dust aerosol containing virus that were transferred from PAA to MSA. The two virus-laden aerosol sources also appear to correspond to the sub-and supermicron peaks found in size-segregated samples. We hypothesize the submicron aerosol may come from the resuspension of virus-laden aerosol from staff apparel due to its higher mobility while the supermicron virus-laden aerosol may come from the resuspension of dust particles from the floors or other hard surfaces. The findings suggest virus-laden aerosols could first deposit on the surface of medical staff protective apparel and the floors in patient areas and are then resuspended by the movements of medical staff. The second batch of TSP samples taken in Fangcang MSAs all tested negative with reduced number of patients from > 200 to 100 per zone and implementation of more rigorous and thorough sanitization measures in Fangcang. The comparison of the two batches of samples showed the effectiveness and importance of sanitization in reducing the airborne SARS-CoV-2 in high risk areas.

People showed more negative emotions (anxiety, depression, and indignation) and less positive emotions (Oxford happiness) after the declaration of COVID-19, which was supported by the theory of BIS, i.e., people did generate more negative emotions for self-protection [3, 4] . These results are consistent to previous studies as well, which found that public health emergencies (e.g., SARS) triggered a series of stress emotional response containing a higher level of anxiety and other negative emotions [32, 33] . Meanwhile, the confirmation that COVID-19 could be passed from person to person on 20 January, which was inconsistent with previous reports, lead to quite a number of people being unsatisfied with misinformation published from provincial governments (e.g., Hubei) and ineffective regulatory actions, causing an increase in indignation. However, it's worth noting that the word frequency of positive emotions increased after 20 January, which seemed to be inconsistent with the theory of BIS. In fact, positive emotion includes words such as faith and blessing, which are more inclined to reflect group cohesiveness rather than pure personal emotions (e.g., happiness). Researchers found that group threats (e.g., natural disasters and epidemic diseases) made groups a community of interests, resulting in more beneficial behaviors and social solidarity, which indicated higher group cohesiveness [34] . For example, lots of provinces (e.g., Sichuan Province, Shandong Province, etc.) formed medical teams to help the Hubei province, which was the worst affected area. Many people donated money and supplies to Hubei Red Cross to support the control of COVID-19.

Subsequently, a surge of cases was observed in the state mainly through the individuals who traveled from Europe and the Middle East to Kerala, thus initiating an outbreak. Since public awareness through dissemination of reliable information plays a significant role in controlling the spread of the disease, the Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins. However, this unstructured data requires refinement and enrichment for upstream applications, such as visualization, and/or analysis. Here we reported a citizen science initiative that leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins, supplemented with the information from media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This data was further used to provide real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. We ensured longevity and reusability of the dataset by depositing it in a public repository, aligning with open source principles for future analytical efforts. Finally, to show the scope of the sourced data, we also provided a snapshot of outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 99 days of the outbreak.

Subsequently, a surge of cases was observed in the state mainly through the individuals who traveled from Europe and the Middle East to Kerala, thus initiating an outbreak. Since public awareness through dissemination of reliable information plays a significant role in controlling the spread of the disease, the Department of Health Services, Government of Kerala initially released daily updates through daily textual bulletins. However, this unstructured data requires refinement and enrichment for upstream applications, such as visualization, and/or analysis. Here we reported a citizen science initiative that leveraged publicly available and crowd-verified data on COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala from the government bulletins, supplemented with the information from media outlets to generate reusable datasets. This data was further used to provide real-time analysis, and daily updates of COVID-19 cases in Kerala, through a user-friendly bilingual dashboard (https://covid19kerala.info/) for non-specialists. We ensured longevity and reusability of the dataset by depositing it in a public repository, aligning with open source principles for future analytical efforts. Finally, to show the scope of the sourced data, we also provided a snapshot of outbreak trends and demographic characteristics of the individuals affected with COVID-19 in Kerala during the first 99 days of the outbreak.

There is growing evidence that lymphocytes are transferred from mother to offspring via milk. In mouse experiments, B-cells carrying a reporter gene could be transferred to suckling mice via milk (Zhou et al., 2000; Arvola et al., 2000) . Breast-feeding mothers transfer lymphocytes to their babies, which induce an immune tolerance of the baby against the mother. One well-documented consequence of this is the fact that breast-feeding mothers are often suitable organ donors for their children in later life (Hanson, 2000) . Immunization during pregnancy may also affect the properties of these transferred immune cells. However, too little is known about lymphocyte transfer from mother to offspring to warrant direct manipulations of this process. Fig. 1 . A transgenic approach to lactogenic immunity: schematic representation of the outcome of a coronavirus infection in naive mice (Mouse 2 and offspring), immunized mice (Mouse 1 and offspring), and transgenic mice expressing a coronavirus-neutralizing antibody (Mouse 3 and offspring). Immunizations against coronaviruses are often short-lived. Therefore, Mouse 1 would only supply virus-neutralizing antibodies to their offspring for a limited time-span. Mouse 3, however, will consistently supply their offspring with large quantities of the recombinant virus-neutralizing antibody throughout every lactation period.

Like SARS, middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a coronavirus. The first cases were reported in Saudi Arabia in the fall of 2012, but the first recognized cases occurred in Jordan earlier that year. All cases of MERS to date have been linked through travel to or residence in countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015 and was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV spreads from ill people to others via close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person, and patients have ranged in age from infants to nonagenarians.

Henipaviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and the rabies-causing lyssaviruses have all been shown to be transmissible from bats to humans-often through an intermediate host-with fatal consequences ( Figure 1 ). Despite the obvious risk bat viruses pose to human health, it must be acknowledged that most outbreaks of batborne zoonotic diseases are a consequence of human activities. From an ecological perspective, bats are a remarkable and ecologically important group with many unique biological features.

A new and highly infectious disease in humans, the severe acute respiratory disease syndrome (SARS), has created a major public health threat in many countries. Within 2 months since its first appearance in Asia in mid-February of 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) has already received reports of the outbreak of SARS in 26 countries on all five continents [1] . The clinical symptoms of SARS are nonspecific, including high fever, dry cough, breathing difficulties, muscle pain, and generalized weakness. The incubation period can last from 2 to 10 days, thus enables symptomless individuals to transmit the disease through either close person-to-person contact or travel from one city to another city in the world. The mortality rate of SARS is about 3-10%. Only recently has the causative agent of this disease been found. The latest multicountry laboratory findings have confirmed that a new pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family never been seen in humans, is the cause of SARS [2] . However, the exact transmission route of the disease is still unknown, and quick diagnostic tests as well as specific treatments are also not yet available. Under these unknown circumstances, prevention is of particular importance in containing the global spread of this new infectious disease. This study aimed to examine factors affecting Hong Kong people's practice of preventive behaviors against SARS. Findings from this study would provide pertinent information in designing and implementing SARS prevention programs not only for Hong Kong, but for other countries as well.

URIs are caused by a plethora of viruses, with rhinovirus being the most common causative agent. 4, 5 Other responsible viruses include coronavirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus. 4, 5 It is even likely that a portion of URIs are caused by viruses that have not yet been identified. 4 The pathophysiology of a URI begins with transmission of the offending agent, which may occur via 3 routes: touching one's nose or eyes after contacting either an infected person or a contaminated object, inhalation of small particle aerosols that were produced by the cough of an infected person, or the sneeze of an infected person resulting in large particle aerosols landing on the nasal mucosa or conjunctiva. 4, 5 The viral agent travels from the eye to the nasal mucosa via the nasolacrimal duct. Once the virus infects the nasal mucosa, it is propelled to the nasopharynx through mucociliary action of the respiratory epithelium lining the nasal cavities. The virus then binds to epithelial cell receptors, which allow it to gain entrance into these cells. Within the epithelial cells rapid viral replication occurs.

COVID-19 is the third coronavirus causing severe pneumonia so far this century, together with those responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV: 8098 cases in 2003 and a case fatality rate of 10% for 7 months) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV: 2458 cases in 2012 and a case fatality rate of 34%). According to the Spanish Ministry of Health, as of 21 February, COVID-19 has accounted for 76 259 cases and 2247 deaths, representing an overall mortality of 2.9%, although in hospitalized patients it ranges between 4.3 2 and 11% 3 . Most cases are in China, but 1174 cases have also been reported in 25 other countries, with 9 deaths and a case fatality rate of 0.8%. All 3 viruses are zoonotic, their origin attributed to bats, with an intermediary step to other mammals (civet cats in SARS, camels in MERS and, it seems, pangolins in COVID-19) 4 . The new virus has probably emerged due to coexistence in the intermediate host of a bat coronavirus and a human one, capable of infecting man and being transmitted from person to person. There are 4 other coronaviruses that can cause the common cold.

Sero-prevalence surveys of asymptomatic animal handlers indicate that cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV occurs from various animal species to humans in the wet market. Palm civets were initially thought to be the source when a SARS-CoV variant was detected in palm civets in Dongmen market, Shenzhen, in 2003 (Guan et al., 2003 Peiris et al., 2003a,b; Wang et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005) , and three of the four SARS patients had direct or indirect contact with palm civets in a restaurant in Guangzhou in the Winter of 2003 −04 (Wang et al., 2005) . Subsequent sequence analysis indicated that the SARS-CoV-like virus had not been circulating among masked civets for long. CoVs highly similar to SARS-CoV were isolated in horseshoe bats in 2005 with 88− 92% sequence homology with human or civet isolates, suggesting that bats could be a natural reservoir of a close ancestor of SARS-CoV (Lau et al., 2010; Li et al., 2005) . Human to Human Transmission of SARS-CoV SARS-CoV spreads by person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets transmission or contact with fomites (Zhao et al., 2003; WHO, 2019a) . A super-spreading event at the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) in Hong Kong resulted in 138 people, including previously healthy healthcare workers (HCWs) being infected within 2 weeks after exposure to a patient with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) admitted to a general medical ward (Lee et al., 2003) . The spread of SARS from the index case to other inpatients in the same medical ward of the PWH appeared consistent with airborne transmission . SARS-CoV has been detected in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions, feces, urine, and tears. SARS can also spread by airborne transmission as highlighted by a major community outbreak at Amoy Gardens, a private residential complex in Hong Kong. The outbreak also extended to nearby residential areas, thought to be by airborne transmission over a distance of 200 meters (Yu et al., 2014) . In Toronto, Canada air samples from a SARS patient's room, and swab samples taken from room surfaces and a nurses' station were positive by SARS-CoV PCR (Booth et al., 2005) .

A rapid and timely measure is through the media coverage to tell people how to prevent the spread of the disease [1] [2] [3] .

As we know, one big characteristic of the infectious disease is the infectiousness, namely the pathogens of infectious disease, can spread from an infected person to a susceptible person through a certain way. The spread ways of the infectious disease are not the same, and its communication process is influenced by natural factors and social factors [4, 5] . When an infectious disease appears, if we can timely find its route of transmission, and encourage people to learn relevant publicity and education of the disease, thus can effectively control the outbreak of the disease. Media coverage may reduce the contact rate of people, which has been found during the spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [6] [7] [8] .

ACE2 as a gateway to SARS During several months of 2003, the virus that caused the newly identified illness severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread rapidly from China throughout Asia to Canada and beyond, causing almost 800 deaths and disrupting travel, economics and even scientific conventions. The death rate following infection approached almost 10%. Almost as mysteriously as it appeared, perhaps as a result of public health measures, the disease faded away only to re-emerge in China this year. The speed with which the infection spread and the severity of the symptoms led to a massive effort to identify the agent responsible. Within months it had been identified as a positive strand RNA virus, classified as a member of the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV); its genome was sequenced [16, 17] and the search was underway to identify the cellular receptor for the virus. As with other coronaviruses, it is the N-terminal portion (S1 domain) of the viral spike (S) glycoprotein that mediates the initial high-affinity binding to a receptor on the surface of susceptible cells. The spike sits in the viral envelope and projects outwards to give a 'corona'-like appearance to the virus, hence its name. The replication strategy of the virus is summarized in Figure 2 , and Figure 3 depicts the coronavirus-infected cell.

The National Health Commission of China (NHCC) has published guidelines for treatment of COVID-19. Recommended antiviral drugs by the NHCC include interferonα, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. 2 As psychiatrists, we are particularly concerned about two aspects of this situation. First, many patients with psychiatric disorders have been infected with COVID-19, and second, patients with COVID-19 infections may develop a number of psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, fear, depression and insomnia, after treatment with antiviral drugs. This is concerning because Wuhan Mental Health Center, the largest psychiatric hospital in Hubei province, reports that more than 80 staff and patients have been infected with COVID-19. 3 If a patient with psychiatric disorder is infected with COVID-19, antiviral drugs must be used in combination with psychotropic drugs, including antipsychotic, antidepressant and antianxiety drugs. If antiviral drugs are used without supplemental medication, patients with psychiatric disorders can experience relapses in their mental illness. Importantly, patients may present with impulsivity, running or other abnormal behaviours that are not conducive to the control of COVID-19. Psychotropic medications are thus necessary to avoid these and other behavioural problems. The most pressing question for doctors on the front line is how to choose the appropriate psychotropic drug in combination with the antivirals recommended by the NHCC.

Importantly, patients may present with impulsivity, running or other abnormal behaviours that are not conducive to the control of COVID-19. Psychotropic medications are thus necessary to avoid these and other behavioural problems. The most pressing question for doctors on the front line is how to choose the appropriate psychotropic drug in combination with the antivirals recommended by the NHCC.

After the outbreak of COVID-19, China government pushed a series of policies to ensure the medical care for patients, such as early diagnosis, early isolation, free treatment and etc. We discuss the peak value and peak time of D(t) in many cases. An index called AM R is well defined to measure the needs of medical resources. Sufficient medical resources is the basic of the disease control. So it is necessary to assign medical resources to deal with the shocks caused by booming demand of patients. To study the detail situation of each province, AM R and original medical power are both considered. We find that, the set up of designated hospital decreases the medical burden sharply. It has released the pressure of diagnosis and isolation in each provinces. But the situation of Hubei is crisis, the disease burden is still huge. Medical workers and materials are transferred to Hubei from other provinces to ensure the control of COVID-19.

It has been more than 1 month since the first 2019-nCoV infected person was diagnosed. So far, 42 638 people have been diagnosed as 2019-nCoV pneumonia, which also known as Wuhan pneumonia, among them, 7333 are severe cases, 1016 patients died, and only 3996 patients have been cured in the mainland of China (Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were excluded). 1 All 31 provincial-level regions and the Xinjiang Production Corps have the confirmed cases. 1 Hubei province, where believed to be the origin of Wuhan pneumonia outbreak, suffers the most, with 31 728 confirmed cases and 974 death cases. 2 The trend of cumulative cases is soaring, including 24 other countries outside of China had confirmed cases. With a remarkable notice that the total number of cases has far exceeded the number during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) period. The first case of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was linked to wild animal trading in the Huanan seafood market in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. 3 Zhou et al 4 found the initial source of 2019-nCoV probably originated from the Chinese horseshoe bat since the novel coronavirus was 96% identical to a bat coronavirus at a whole genome level. This coronavirus, which has not been identified in humans previously, had been detected from patients in Coronaviruses are a huge family of viruses, of which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-nCoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCoV), and so on have already known by humans. 8 The 2019-nCoV has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days in general, with a maximum of 14 days. 9 The most common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. 9,10 While a few patients might have stuffiness, pharyngalgia, or diarrhea. 9 By far, the main sources of infection are 2019-nCoV infected humans, however, the asymptomatic infection might also be a source of infection. 9 These patients are not easy to be detected among the population when initially infected but might have headache, fever, dyspnea, fatigue, and so on later. 11 This type of coronavirus has been proved could spread from person to person through the respiratory tract and contact transmission. 9 be similar of SARS. 14 Mild and occult cases could be the major concerns for disease prevention. 15, 16 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a medical mask when leaving homes 17 and ethanol and the high temperature had been proved could prevent disease occurrence. 9 The event has been determined as a Public

Herein, we developed a multiplexed helicase assay based on graphene oxide (GO) for high-throughput screening of inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) helicase. Previously, we reported a GO-based helicase assay (GOHA), which relied on the preferential binding of ssDNA over dsDNA to the GO surface and subsequent quenching of the fluorescently labeled ssDNA by energy transfer from the dyes to the GO, and we validated the assay using SARS CoV helicase. [10] Herein, we show that the GOHA can be used for measuring the activities of HCV NS3 helicase and SARS CoV helicase in a single mixed solution using two distinct DNA substrates tethered to different fluorophores, and furthermore, for multiplexed high-throughput screening to discover highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of these helicases ( Figure 1 ). One round of screening the chemical library using the multiplexed GOHA (mGOHA) revealed three classes of inhibitors-specific inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase, specific inhibitors of SARS CoV helicase, and general inhibitors of both helicases. To date, GO has been used to develop various biosensors and enzyme assays, [10, 11] but concerns about the heterogeneity of the chemical structure and the physical dimensions of GO and nonspecific binding of biomolecules to GO hamper the application of GO-based assays in high-throughput parallel assays for drug discovery that require high robustness and reproducibility. Herein, we show that GO can be used for the discovery of potent smallmolecule drug candidates and also determine the specificity and relative effectiveness towards each helicase of each of the identified hits.

As known as COVID-19, coronavirus disease outbreaks in Wuhan, China since Dec. 2019, and rapidly spreads nationwide and globally [1, 2] . As a form of pneumonia, the infection causes inflammation of air sacs in one or both lungs and fills with fluid or pus, making the patient difficult to breathe. According to recent report, its lethal rate reaches 2% [3] , second only to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) of 10% and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) of 36% [4, 5] . Also, it could transmit from person to person with a relatively high basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2, and has no efficient treatments and control strategies till now [6] . Therefore, screening of COVID-19 out of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is important for patient triage, treatment protocol design, and follow-up evaluation.

The disease is common in cattle in the southern and western United States. Anaplasma organisms are spread biologically or mechanically. Mechanical transmission occurs when infected red blood cells are passed from one host to another on the mouthparts of seasonal biting flies. Sometimes mosquitoes or instruments such as dehorners or hypodermic needles may facilitate transfer of infected red cells from one animal to another. Biological transmission occurs when the tick stage of the organism is passed by Dermacentor andersoni and D. occidentalis ticks. The carrier stage covers the time when discernible Anaplasma organisms can be found on host blood smears. Recovered animals serve as immune carriers and disease reservoirs.

In December, 2019, COVID-19 was recognised as a novel respiratory disease in Wuhan, China, 1 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 2 Accurate and reliable data on SARS-CoV-2 incubation time, secondary attack rate, and transmission dynamics are key to successful containment. In late January, 2020, infection with SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Germany for the first time. By rapid response, the public health authorities identified a business meeting in a Bavarian company as the primary transmission site and a participating Chinese employee who had travelled from Shanghai to Munich as the index patient. 3 Subsequently, the rigorous investigation of contacts led to detection of 16 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and to successful containment of this outbreak. This well defined event with limited extent of transmission enabled Merle Böhmer and colleagues to provide a meticulous description of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in an Article published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. 4 The authors did standard and in-depth interviews with case patients and household members to determine the characteristics and the onset of symptoms. Data were used for calculation of SARS-CoV-2 secondary attack rates, defined as the probability that an infection occurs among susceptible people within the incubation period. 5 In addition, whole genome sequencing of virus isolates was done in 15 of the 16 cases. As a result, Böhmer and colleagues report a detailed transmission network of the outbreak, which is accurately displayed in the main figure of the Article. 4 What are the main lessons to be learned from the analysis of this outbreak? First, the study allows some conclusions on the infectivity of the virus in relation to the intensity of contacts. While 11 out of 217 individuals (secondary attack rate of 5·1%, 95% CI 2·6-8·9) with high-risk non-household contact (defined as cumulative face-to-face contact to a laboratory-confirmed case for ≥15 min, direct contact with secretions or body fluids of a patient with confirmed COVID-19, or, in the case of health-care workers, had worked within 2 m of a patient with confirmed COVID-19 without personal protective equipment) got infected, none of the low-risk contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This observation underlines the value of current recommendations of physical distancing as a cornerstone of infection control in this pandemic. However, the intriguing case of a transmission event in two people sitting back to back in a canteen, who only had a very short face-to-face contact while exchanging a salt shaker, shows that the categorisation of high-risk and low-risk contacts has its limitations, too.

This illustration shows three potential ways SARS-CoV-2 can spread from an infected host to a susceptible host. First, it is transmitted person to person (direct contact) through respiratory droplets. These droplets can travel for distances 6 feet or less in air. Second, SARS-CoV-2 is likely transmitted through fomites (indirect contact) for the duration it is viable on environmental surfaces. Third, it is also likely transmitted through aerosols (indirect contact) for distances longer than 6 feet in the air.

Acting swiftly and mobilizing precautionary measures can substantially aid in flattening the disease incidence curve, thereby reducing the number of critically ill patients who will need medical treatment all at the same time. This, in turn, reduces the burden on the healthcare system that takes care of patients presenting with the most feared complication of COVID-19, i.e., severe bilateral pneumonia (4). This concept, now widely referred to as flattening the curve, gives critically ill patients a fighting chance to survive by obtaining life-saving supportive therapy in hospitals. This, therefore, significantly reduces the mortality rate (1) . If the number of critically ill patients is higher than what can be accommodated in hospitals, many more patients will die due to the lack of life-saving medical attention.

There are two different approaches in probe design to study of RNA splicing using DNA microarrays: tiling and exon arrays [ 22 ] (Fig. 38.6b ). In tiling arrays the set of overlapping probes cover the full-length of nascent primary transcript including exons and introns. The analysis of fl orescence for each probe allows to identify exons and introns based on the difference in signal intensity ( Fig. 38 .6b i ). The advantage of tiling arrays is their ability to identify known as well as new splice events. Therefore, the tilling arrays are often used as discovery tools. The disadvantages are . When bound to unspliced transcript the binding sites of two probes are separated by intron preventing energy transfer by FRET and thus, no signal is generated. After intron removal by RNA splicing, two probes are bought to close proximity for FRET to occur. The energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor leads to excitation of the acceptor fl uorophore (A in circle with spikes ) and generation of detectable signal. The diagram is modi fi ed from Blanco and Artero [ 31 ] requirement of large amount of probes and are time-consuming data analysis. The exon arrays are more commonly used but require the knowledge of splicing events. Several types of probes hybridizing to fl anking exons, intron, and exon-exon junctions are designed to detect each splicing event ( Fig. 38.6b ii ). The fl uorescence intensity is detected for each probe and mathematical model is applied to determine the occurrence of splicing event. The advantages of exon arrays are: the requirement of smaller number of probes with simpler data analysis. However, the exon arrays detect only known or predicted splicing variants. Due to their large capacities the exon arrays could be designed to detect splicing in multiple viral pathogens.

Predicting the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic is a central priority for guiding epidemic 49 responses around the world. China has undergone its first epidemic wave and, remarkably, cities across 50 the country are now reporting few or no locally-acquired cases 8 . Analyses have indicated that that the 51 spread of COVID-19 from Hubei to the rest of China was driven primarily by human mobility 6 and the 52 stringent measures to restrict human movement and public gatherings within and among cities in China 53 have been associated with bringing local epidemics under control 5 . Key uncertainties remain as to which 54 geographic factors drive local transmission dynamics and affect the intensity of transmission of COVID-55 19. For respiratory pathogens, "epidemic intensity" (i.e., the peakedness of the number of cases through 56 time, or the shortest period during which the majority of cases are observed) varies with increased indoor 57 crowding, and socio-economic and climatic factors 9-14 . Epidemic intensity is minimized when incidence 58 is spread evenly across weeks and increases as incidence becomes more focused in particular days 59 ( Figure 1C , see a detailed description of how epidemic intensity is defined in Ref. 9 ).

Our study suggests that genetic polymorphisms located in IL-7R and IL-15R genes can influence the rate of disease progression in HIV+ patients, especially when a combination of aplotypes is present. Mutations in the coding regions might compromise the binding of the cytokines or the intracellular signal transduction pathways, therefore leading to the alteration of CD4 and CD8 T cells homeostasis. Aims: Mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) are GPI-anchored ectoenzymes that covalently modify cell-surface or soluble target proteins by transferring an ADPribose moiety from extracellular NAD+ to specific arginine residues of target proteins. In this study, we report that human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is ADPribosylated by ART1, and that ADP-ribosylation affects both the release of TNF from cells and its cytolytic action. Methods: Transcription of ART1 in human leukocytes was analyzed by RT-PCR. ADP-ribosylation of TNF was detected by monitoring the incorporation of ADPribose from labeled NAD. Release of TNF from transfected HEK cells was monitored by ELISA. Binding of TNF to TNF receptors was analyzed by Biacore. TNF cytotoxicity was monitored by flow cytometry. The ADP-ribosylation site on TNF was analyzed by LC/MS mass spectrometry. Results: We identified ART1 transcripts by RT-PCR analysis in human blood leukocytes. Soluble ART1, released from the surface of transfected cells by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), ADP-ribosylated recombinant human TNF in vitro. Co-transfection of HEK293 cells with ART1 and TNF resulted in modification of TNF at at least 2 distinct sites, i. e. one within the TNF ectodomain, and one on the stalk that remains connected with the cell membrane after cleavage by TNFa Converting Enzyme (TACE). Analysis of modified recombinant TNF by mass spectrometry provided evidence that the TNF ectodomain is ADP-ribosylated at R32, a site that has previously been implicated in binding to TNFR2. Binding assays indicated that ADP-ribosylation inhibited binding of TNF to its receptors. Importantly, modified TNF was less potent at inducing cell death in the human T cell lymphoma line KIT225 than wildtype TNF. Furthermore, cell surface ADP-ribosylation of HEK cells co-transfected with TNF and ART1 resulted in reduced release of TNF into the supernatant. Conclusions: ADP-ribosylation of TNF or other cell surface proteins interferes with the biology of TNF signals by at least two distinct mechanisms. ADPribosylation of TNF blocks binding to its receptors, thereby inhibiting TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, ADP-ribosylation of TNF or another protein on the surface of TNF-producing cells inhibits the proteolytic release of TNF.

Today we know that rabies infections represent only one extreme of crossspecies infections between bats and humans. It can be described as a single infection "spillover" event, hence the very low number of cases. Were it not for the dreaded consequences of this disease, it would probably not attract medical attention. A major barrier against viral spillover between species is the species barrier. Unfortunately, this concept is more a time con fi rmed empirical medical concept than a much investigated experimentally phenomenon. What leads to breaches in this barrier? One could imagine that spillovers occur primarily between species with high ecological contact rates. Alternatively, the height of the barrier might be determined by host genetics factors. Streicker and colleagues ( 2010 ) have addressed this question by sequencing the nucleoprotein gene in nearly 400 rabies viruses isolated from 23 bat species. They identi fi ed 43 unambiguous cross-species infections. Their observations amount to one trans-species for every 73 within-species transmission events. These authors also observed that the intensity of the trans-species transmission declined continuously with the genetic difference between donor and recipient species. Transmission increased less with the extent of geographical overlap between species habitats. The authors concluded that the vast majority of the trans-species infections of bats with rabies virus are evolutionary dead-ends. From these data it appears that this highly mutable RNA virus does not represent a major concern for introduction of a bat virus into the human population. Can this relatively assuring conclusion be generalized to other viruses of bats? Unfortunately, the answer is No. In subsequent paragraphs, we will recognize cross-infections from bats that led to transient outbreaks (e.g. Nipah virus infections) and even sustained epidemics with the potential of endemic establishment (e.g. SARS corona virus) in the human population. There is another reason not to be complacent with bat rabies. Virologists from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where Louis Pasteur had developed the fi rst rabies vaccine, had sequenced many lyssaviruses (how rabies virus is called taxonomically) isolated from carnivoran and chiropteran (" fi nger-wings", the systematical name of bats) hosts. The phylogenetic tree of the surface glycoprotein which is responsible for receptor recognition revealed seven genotypes (Badrane and Tordo 2001 ) . The long branches on the tree were all bat viruses. Genotype 1, the classical rabies group, was found in bats and carnivoran mammals. The carnivoran rabies viruses were all small twigs on the glycoprotein tree suggesting recent introduction. Using the tree, the authors deduced two spillover events, one into raccoons and another, independent event into the other carnivores (dog, fox, wolf, skunk, mongoose) which then spread worldwide without much diversi fi cation. Using molecular clock arguments, the authors dated this spillover to the time of the decline of the Roman Empire. They explained the fact that rabies was already described in cuneiform tablets in Mesopotamia 4,000 years ago by the hypothesis that this represented a spillover event with a rabies virus which became in the meanwhile extinct. In an even bolder hypothesis, the Pasteur authors speculated that bats had acquired the lyssaviruses from their insect prey. Indeed, rhabdoviruses are a prominent insect pathogen and another rhabdovirus, Mokola virus (known from two human case reports) was also isolated from an insectivorous mammal (this time a shrew) and this virus could be propagated on insect cells. According to the Pasteur scientists the spillover from insects to bats might have occurred 10,000 years ago.

In the fall of 2012, individuals travelling from the Arabian Peninsula to the United Kingdom were affected by the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a severe lower respiratory tract infection that resembled SARS, leading also to gastrointestinal symptoms and renal failure among some patients [221] . Molecular sequencing rapidly showed that the new epidemic was caused by a new coronavirus: the MERS-CoV [193, 222, 223] . MERS-CoV most probably originated from bats before infecting an intermediary reservoir (the dromedary camel), and also represented a zoonotic transmission to humans. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that there have been multiple independent zoonotic introductions of the virus in the human population. Moreover, nosocomial transmission was observed in multiple hospitals in Saudi Arabia [221, [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] .

The novel coronavirus was first detected in December 2019 during the outbreak of severe pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease caused by the virus outbreak was finally named COVID-19, which stands for the coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019, and the etiologic virus SARS-CoV-2, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 by WHO. Scientific investigation is underway to learn more about the virus, its origin, and how it affects humans, and the situation is changing rapidly. Most of the first patients in COVID-19 claimed to be related to the Huanan Seafood market in Wuhan, indicating that the virus had a zoonotic origin. However, the source of the virus remains to be determined. Bats, known as a reservoir for most viruses, might be the original host of the new strain, but the intermediate animal host is unknown. The virus is similar to SARS-CoV-like CoV in bats but is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. One study suggests that the virus may be a recombination of a bat CoV with a CoV of unknown origin, possibly from snakes [83] , but there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Human-tohuman transmission has been confirmed in communities and medical institutions in China, as well as in Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, Germany, and the United States [84, 85] . Preliminary assessment of the transmission dynamics of the first 425 confirmed cases found that before January 1, 2020, 55% of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan; after this date, only 8.6% of the cases were associated with this market [86] . This confirms that human-to-human transmission has occurred between close contacts since the middle of December 2019 [86] . Infections that occurred among health workers were also identified [86] . It is unclear how easily the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Asymptomatic carriers can become contagious to others, as there have been confirmed reports of transmission from asymptomatic contacts in Germany [87] .

Respiratory viruses infect the human upper respiratory tract, mostly causing mild diseases.

Respiratory viruses can also exacerbate asthma and lead to various types of respiratory distress syndromes. Furthermore, as they can adapt fast and cross the species barrier, some of these pathogens, like influenza A and SARS-CoV, have occasionally caused epidemics or pandemics, and were associated with more serious clinical diseases and even mortality. For a few decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that several respiratory viruses have neuroinvasive capacities, since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Viruses infecting human CNS cells could then cause different types of encephalopathy, including encephalitis, and long-term neurological diseases. Like other well-recognized neuroinvasive human viruses, respiratory viruses may damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuro-immunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly causes damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). The etiological agent of several neurological disorders remains unidentified. Opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of these disorders whose etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present a global portrait of some of the most prevalent or emerging human respiratory viruses that have been associated with possible pathogenic processes in CNS infection, with a special emphasis on human coronaviruses.

Cases have been detected in health care workers, like with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome)-corona virus outbreaks (Grant et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020) . SARS caused a major outbreak in the beginning of 2000s mostly in Asia, the source was civet cats. MERS transmits from camels to humans in Middle East. The source for both may be originally bats (Cui et al., 2019) . The novel SARS-CoV-2 is closely phylogenetically related to SARS coronavirus with 89% similarity. The genetic code for SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced and published in a record time and relation to other coronaviruses known in days.

T he COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and its course is altering the landscape for all citizens of the world, including plastic surgeons. Much remains unknown. However, an increasing body of evidence is guiding swift global action against the virus. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019, notably close to a wet animal market that sells poultry, snakes, and bats. 1 The virus shares most of its genetic sequence with coronaviruses found in bats and is thought to arise from that animal, although an infected bat with SARS-CoV- 2 has not yet been identified to confirm this theory. 2 From Wuhan, the virus crossed over to the human population and spread throughout China and beyond: by March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, which is the worldwide spread of a new disease that crosses continents and affects a large number of people. 3 Details regarding the behavior and implications of the virus are emerging daily. The virus is spread person-to-person and appears to linger in the air for up to 3 hours and upon various surfaces from 24 hours to 3 days. 4 Accordingly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend contact and airborne precautions with personal protective equipment (PPE) and N95 respirators. 5 The virus utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor as its entry point, which is located predominantly in the lung alveolar epithelial cells and the enterocytes of the small intestine. 6 Accordingly, COVID-19 presents both as an upper respiratory infection characterized by cough, fever, and fatigue that progresses to pneumonia and as a gastrointestinal illness characterized by diarrhea. 7 The progression from mild symptoms to respiratory failure requiring ventilation can be rapid, and cardiac failure has also been implicated. Chest radiographs reveal bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, and computed tomography of the lungs reveals ground glass opacities. 8 At the moment, supportive therapies are indicated as treatment. While there are no specific treatments officially, medications are being tested including hydroxychloroquine (a retrofitted antimalaria and autoimmune drug, which has been employed in China and France) and antiretrovirals such as remdesivir. [9] [10] [11] There is no approved prophylactic medication at this time. Vaccines are under development as a long-term approach aimed toward prevention ( Table 1) .

Emerging infectious disease (EID) epidemics and pandemics arise without warning, even with global efforts aimed at tracking pathogens early and at the source, a fact most recently evidenced by the swift global spread of influenza H1N1 [1, 2] and a current outbreak of ebolavirus affecting multiple West African countries simultaneously [3] . Most major human EIDs are of zoonotic origin and include viral infections of both global (HIV-1, HIV-2, H1N1) and localized significance (ebolavirus, monkeypox, Marburgvirus, Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-associated coronavirus) [2] . Systematic monitoring of people and wildlife at hotspots of EID is one strategy for preventing human pathogens of animal origin from reaching a pandemic state [4] . By detecting animal pathogens before or just as they emerge in humans, it may be possible to mitigate against their worldwide spread [2] . Furthermore, in the case of some diseases such as Ebola virus disease (EVD), the monitoring of wildlife disease serves as a critical component of early warning systems aimed at preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans [5, 6] . EVD has repeatedly passed from infected apes to hunters, leading to multiple epidemics and 360 human deaths (463 cases) in Gabon and the Republic of Congo (RoC) alone since 1994 [5, [7] [8] [9] . More significantly, human epidemics are often preceded by observed animal outbreaks, underlining the human health implications of surveillance and control of epizootics [5, 6] .

MERS-CoV is mainly transmitted from infected dromedary camels to human beings , and it is transmitted among human beings by droplets , contact , and perhaps airborne spread .	Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging infectious disease of growing global importance, which has caused severe acute respiratory disease in more than 1,700 people, resulting in almost 600 deaths. MERS is caused by a novel betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV). All cases of MERS have been linked through travel to or residence in countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula. Dromedary camels are considered natu- ral reservoirs for MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is mainly transmitted from infected dromedary camels to human beings, and it is transmitted among human beings by droplets, contact, and perhaps airborne spread. Both community-acquired and hospital-acquired cases have been reported with little human-to-human transmis- sion reported in the community. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula oc- curred in the Republic of Korea in 2015, with 186 cases. The outbreak was associated with a traveler re- turning from the Arabian Peninsula. Clinical features of MERS range from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure resulting in death, especially in individuals with underlying comorbidities. MERS is suspected in the presence of febrile acute respiratory illness and close contact with MERS-CoV, and can be confirmed by the detection of viral nucleic acid through RT-PCR or se- rology. No specific drug treatment exists for MERS; however, the neutralizing antibodies, ribavirin and interferon have been shown to be potentially useful anti-MERS-CoV drugs. Rigorous infection prevention and control measures with droplet and contact precautions are crucial to prevent the spread in health-care facilities. [Review].

Homology utilizes structure and sequence similarities for predicting unknown protein structures. The Homology module in Insight II allows us to build the 3D models of the target protein (i.e., M pro S) using both its amino acid sequence and the structures of known, related model proteins (i.e., M pro H and M pro T). The Homology program provides simultaneous optimization of both structure and sequence homologies for multiple proteins in a 3D graphics environment, based on a method developed by Greer. 37 Smith-Waterman pairwise amino acid sequence alignments were performed based on the conserved active site and substrate binding subsites among M pro from various coronaviruses to find the location of the active site and substrate binding subsite of M pro S. The consensus structural conserved regions (SCRs) of the target protein were generated from alignments of the target protein to the model proteins. The atomic coordinates were then transferred from the model proteins to the target protein in each SCR using the Mutation Matrix module of the Insight II program. Automatic loop building was performed either by database searching 38 or generation through random conformational search. 39 The coordinates at the N-and Ctermini of these loops were then automatically assigned. Side chains of the target protein were automatically replaced, preserving the conformations of the model proteins. The side chain conformations were optimized either manually or automatically using a rotamer library. 24 Similar secondary structure motifs were identified by database searching and predicted by DSSP. 40 The bond lengths and torsion angles in the SCRs and loop regions were repaired and relaxed using Homology/Refine/SpliceRepair and Homology/Refine/Relax, respectively. The newly built structures of the target protein were substantially refined to avoid van der Waals radius overlapping, unfavorable atomic distances, and undesirable torsion angles using molecular mechanics and dynamics features in the Discover module.

Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) is antibody transferred from serum to egg yolk of poultry in order to protect the developing embryo from potential pathogens. Using antigen-specific immunity response, a mass of specific IgY can be obtained from egg yolks of laying hens. Recently, IgY has attracted considerable interest as therapeutic and diagnostic agent. Up to now, specific IgYs have been widely applied to the treatment of infectious diseases caused by various kinds of bacteria, including Escherichia coli [8, 9] , Helicobacter pylori [10] , Salmonella [11] , Staphylococcus aureus [12, 13] , Streptococcus mutants [14] , Yersinia ruckeri [15] . Infections caused by virus, such as rotavirus [16] , coronavirus [17] and enterovirus [18] , could also be interfered by specific IgYs. Even so, IgY specific to A. baumannii has not been reported.

Microorganisms Entering by the Oral Route For the adenovirus types 40 and 41, astrovirus, norovirus, and human rotavirus (all causing gastroenteritis), as well as for hepatitis A virus, strong epidemiological and laboratory evidence of transfer through fomites is available. 2,3,7 -9,11,22,29,34 -38 Based on a theoretical rationale (numbers of organisms shed, survival on hands and on fomites, and infectious dose) and epidemiological evidence (person-toperson spread), transfer of Shigella dysenteriae , Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli , Enteroinvasive E coli , and Salmonella typhi in numbers exceeding the infectious dose is also possible. 7,25,27,39 -43 Intestinal protozoa such as Cryptosporidium spp. (oocysts), Giardia lamblia (cysts), and helminths such as Enterobius vermicularis (egg) meet the requirements for transfer through fi ngerprinting, and the role of fomites in their transmission has been described. 7, 44 Microorganisms Entering by the Respiratory Route Strong epidemiological evidence in favor of transfer through fomites is present for adenovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), and RSV. In addition, both experimental and laboratory data have been provided for parainfl uenza virus, rhinovirus, and infl uenzavirus (including the H5N1 strain). 3,4,34,45 -50 Severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus is possibly transmitted Infection Transmission Through Fingerprinting at Visa Application through fomites: high secondary attack rate events ( " super spreading events " ) suggest possible fecaloral transmission with contamination of the environment. 51 ,52 A number of bacterial pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus infl uenzae , Neisseria meningitidis , Bordetella pertussis , and Corynebacterium diphtheriae can survive on fomites, and transmission through articles soiled with respiratory discharges has been described. However, their capacity for survival on fomites is poor, and evidence for indirect contact transmission had not been thoroughly documented. 25, 34 Microorganisms Entering via the Skin Finger lesions caused by HSV1 (herpetic whitlow) are mainly transmitted by direct contact, but indirect transmission is not excluded as the virus survives drying on fomites. 25 Microorganisms Causing Secondary Infections A number of bacteria and yeasts may cause respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections, especially in hospitalized patients. They include, among others, S aureus , Enterobacter spp., E coli , Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterococcus spp., and Candida albicans . From a technical standpoint, their capability of being transferred through fi ngerprinting is excellent: they survive for extended periods on fomites (especially in the presence of organic material) and persist for at least 30 minutes on hands. 25 Laboratory experiments have demonstrated hand -fomite transfer and vice versa for C albicans and Enterococcus faecium . 53, 54 Further, these microorganisms have been implicated in common source outbreaks related to medical, household, or administrative equipment. The exact role of fomites in these outbreaks is diffi cult to ascertain, but in a number of cases, molecular techniques proved strain identity between the infecting strain and that present on the fomite. 4, 36 Although infection transmissions through fomites remain rare events in the healthcare setting, several points are of concern: (1) many of the bacterial species may develop resistance to antibiotics and (2) these multidrug-resistant strains are spreading from hospitals to nonhospital care facilities (nursing homes and long-term care facilities) and next to the community. 55, 56 Transmission Risk and Health Impact The transmission risk of an infection caused by a particular microorganism combines the capability of transfer of this microorganism through fi ngerprinting in doses exceeding the infectious dose and the probability of exposure, ie, the probability that a person shedding the organisms will present for fi ngerprinting. In the absence of a particular outbreak, highest probabilities of exposure can be expected for (1) enteric viruses such as rotavirus and (2) respiratory viruses such as RSV, infl uenzavirus, and parainfl uenzavirus. Other microorganisms occur in epidemics that are notoriously diffi cult to contain, eg, norovirus (gastroenteritis in hotels and cruise ships), adenovirus (conjunctivitis in the healthcare setting), and S dysenteriae (dysentery in large-scale epidemics). 38, 42 The health impact of a disease also differs according to local epidemiology. Worldwide, infections with human rotavirus causes have a case fatality rate of 0.4%, but in industrialized countries, it is as low as 0.03%. 10 Another example is hepatitis A infection: where environmental sanitation is poor, infection caused by hepatitis A is common and occurs at an early age. At this age, the disease is benign. In countries with high hygienic standards, most adults have never been infected and remain susceptible to infection, and persons aged 50 years or older have an increased risk of complications. 38 Using Monte Carlo risk analysis on US data, the mean number of transmissions of human rotavirus per million fi ngerprint-capturing procedures among adult applicants was estimated as 191 (95% CI 0 -289). When, after fi ngerprint capturing, hands are washed with soap and water, this does not result in a marked decrease of transmission (189 transmissions, 95% CI 0 -277). Application of 70% isopropyl hand rub and 85% ethanol gel reduces the risk to 77 (95% CI 0 -118) and 0.3 (95% CI 0 -0.3) transmissions per million procedures, respectively. Due to the short contact time, small surface, and low pressure, index reading has a transmission risk that is approximately 100-to 1,000-fold lower than that of fi ngerprint capturing.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the globe since its first outbreak in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which spreads from human to human primarily via aerosols from coughing or sneezing, but also via contaminated surfaces (1) . SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by endocytosis after binding to the transmembrane angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein on cells in the lung, heart, blood vessels, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract (2) . The diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed by a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nose, throat, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. The sensitivity of this test is suboptimal (50-80%), probably due to sampling error, low viral loads as well as timing of the sample in the disease course (3, 4) . In most COVID-19 patients, non-contrast chest CTscanning shows bilateral ground glass opacities with a peripheral and basal distribution. The sensitivity of CT-imaging, not specificity, may be higher than the standard nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR (5) .

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a major emerging zoonotic infectious disease. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.

Since late Dec. 2019, an increase in incidence of cases of pneumonia were initially reported to be of unknown origin. These were subsequently identified as 2019-novel coronary virus infection (COVID-19) [1, 2] . The total number of diagnosed patients reached 75,465 in China by Feb. 20th, 2020 [3] . Most of the early cases stated that they had previously visited Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, but initially no direct evidence was found that the virus could be transmitted from person to person. As the cases accumulated, it was discovered that more and more clustered and sporadic patients had never visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market, but the evidence of human-to-human transmission had not yet surfaced when medical staff were repeatedly diagnosed with COVID-19 [4] . According to a recent release, more than 3,000 medical staff in China were diagnosed with COVID-19, among whom 6 died. Here we report two separate nosocomial outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 involving 20 medical staff in a hospital within one week. To our knowledge, these two nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19 were the earliest cases of patient to medical staff transmission.

A novel coronavirus was isolated from COVID-19 patients, which was initially named novel coronavirus-2019 and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is the 7th coronavirus that could pro-duce human infection, with the previous six species including 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] . A recently published article showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a 79.5% identity with SARS-CoV and 96% with a bat coronavirus [1] . The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are very similar to SARS [2] , ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia. Vertical transmission is a common transmission routine for some contagious disease, by which the pathogens passed from mother to the child across the placenta, through direct contact during delivery, or in the breast milk. Some coronavirus, such as 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, are common respiratory viruses, which have proven to be characteristic of vertical transmission [4] . However, based on the limited evidence, the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV and middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus is still not confirmed [5] [6] [7] [8] . On Feb 5, 2020, a neonatal patient with COVID-19, born to a mother with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, was diagnosed based on a positive nucleic acid test from the oropharyngeal swab 30 h after birth. It raises concerns among obstetricians, neonatologists, and public health agencies about the possibility of mother-to-child transmission of this novel coronavirus. Medical experts said it could be a case where the infection was contracted in uterine, but it is also possible the baby was infected after birth from having close contact with the mother [9] .

One study recruited ten neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. The nucleic acid test was performed on pharyngeal swab samples collected from 9 neonates from 1 to 9 days after birth, and all tests were negative [10] . The similar results were presented on another subsequent study, which sent the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from 6 pregnant women with COVID-19 for nucleic acid test and all samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [11] . In our case, amniotic fluid, vaginal secretions, placenta, cord blood, breast milk, venous blood from mother, and the throat and anal swab, sputum, venous blood, urine samples from the newborn were all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the published studies. These existing pieces of evidence are predictive of low risk of motherto-child transmission for SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive tested case in the world, providing the most convincing evidence to the question of whether there is a mother-to-child vertical transmission of this novel coronavirus. However, the possibility of viral load influencing the transmission risk should be of concern. Published studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between the viral load of some viruses and their ability to spread from mother to child [12, 13] ; it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics. In this case, we cannot estimate the mother's highest viral load before delivery, because she received the initial test on 6d of symptom onset, already after viral load reached the peak at 3 to 5d [14] [15] [16] . Therefore, at this time point, although the risk is minimal, it still cannot exclude the possibility that a much higher viral load might lead to vertical transmission.

This procedure is not sufficient for those cases where the risk of a laboratory accident extends beyond those working in the laboratory or nearby-to a much larger, even global, population, who might be infected and greatly harmed by a pathogen that is both highly virulent to humans and readily transmissible [31] . As I will argue below, that category of research is a very limited categoryroughly covered by the terms PPP creation or GoFRoC. The accident risk posed by performing an activity for a particular period of time is conventionally defined as the product of two factors: the probability that an accident will occur during that period, times the expected magnitude of harm that the accident causes. For the vast majority of pathogens studied in the laboratory, accidental infection of a laboratory worker or other person poses little risk to the broader population. This is because most pathogens we study have one or more of the following properties that limit the impact of an accidental infection: l The pathogen is not transmissible from person to person (e.g., anthrax) or is somewhat transmissible but would be readily contained in a developed-world setting (e.g., filoviruses). l The pathogen is already widespread (and possibly usually carried asymptomatically), such that adding one more infected person to the pool of infected persons would have a negligible impact on the overall risk of transmission (e.g., the bacterial species that constitute the normal flora of the gut and respiratory tract). l Transmission of the pathogen is limited by widespread vaccine coverage (e.g., measles virus, Bordetella pertussis, and other targets of routine vaccination). l Transmission of the pathogen is locally limited by lack of a suitable vector (e.g., flaviviruses in sufficiently cool climates).

MHV is a β-CoV within the Coronaviridae family (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with large genomes of approximately 31 kb. Coronaviruses, including various strains of MHV, are neurotropic, hepatotropic, pneumotropic or enterotropic, causing a variety of diseases in humans and domestic and companion animals. For the purpose of this review, we will focus on those MHV variants that cause acute and chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis. Neurotropic strains of MHV tend to cause similar diseases in all strains of mice, except SJL mice, which encode a variant of the host cell receptor (CEACAM1b in lieu of CEACAM1a, Carcinoembryonic Antigen-related Cell Adhesion Molecule 1) (Ohtsuka et al., 1996; Williams et al., 1991) . Studies of MHV generally use the neurotropic JHMV strain or its attenuated variant, J2.2-V-1 or the hepatotropic/neurotropic A59 strain (Bergmann et al., 2006; Cowley and Weiss, 2010; Lavi et al., 1984) . As noted above, several studies indicated that myelin destruction in MHV-infected mice occurs during virus clearance. Thus, transfer of T cells to J2.2-V-1-infected RAG1 −/− mice resulted in complete or partial virus clearance and demyelination within a few days of transfer, even though no demyelination was noted in the absence of transfer (Wu et al., 2000) . Spleen cells from MHV-immunized mice were most effective in inducing demyelination. Transfer of splenic cells from naïve mice to infected mice could also induce demyelination, but only in a minority of mice, likely reflecting the presence of only a small number of virus-specific T cells in the naïve spleen (Houtman and Fleming, 1996) . Additionally, while both virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells individually induced myelin destruction, transfer of CD4 T cells resulted in a rapidly fatal encephalomyelitis while CD8 T cell transfer caused extensive demyelination without clinical signs of encephalomyelitis (Wu et al., 2000) . Lethal disease after CD4 T cell transfer was largely TNF driven because transfer of TNF −/− CD4 T cells resulted in greatly diminished morbidity, mortality and demyelination, with eventual virus clearance in many of the mice (unpublished data).

The Coronaviridae have been recognized for many years as a cause of common-cold-like, self-limiting respiratory infections (Monto, 1998) , but the 2003 emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) brought new recognition that coronavirus infection could result in serious, even fatal, disease. The etiologic agent of SARS was quickly identified as a previously unknown coronavirus (Drosten et al., 2003) . Emerging in an age of global travel, large healthcare facilities, and high-density housing developments, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was not only a novel human pathogen, but one that spread by novel routes. A respiratory agent transmitted from person-to-person by droplets and aerosols, SARS-CoV spread from passenger to passenger on an airplane (Olsen et al., 2003) and from patients to healthcare workers and visitors in hospitals (Seto et al., 2003; Varia et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004) . As efforts increased to halt further person-toperson spread of the disease from travelers and in healthcare facilities, an outbreak of SARS in a high-density Hong Kong housing complex led to the discovery of a new route of transmission, previously unknown for a respiratory virus. In this outbreak, SARS-CoV shed in the feces of an infected building visitor may have spread disease to other occupants of the building via droplets and aerosols of virus-contaminated commode water, which entered multiple apartments through faulty toilet plumbing and floor drains (McKinney et al., 2006) . This outbreak scenario suggests that if SARS were to reemerge in the future, water contaminated with the fecal waste of infected individuals could be a vehicle for transmission. This unique fecal droplet-respiratory route is potentially important, but aspects of it remain poorly understood. One such aspect is the role of viral stability: if SARS-CoV is capable of surviving for relatively long periods of time in water, exposure and transmission via fecally contaminated droplets of water may be more likely. In order to better assess the risks posed by this novel exposure pathway, data are needed on the survival and persistence of SARS-CoV in water and sewage. Because working with SARS requires specially trained personnel working in BSL-3 laboratory containment, there are significant challenges involved in studying the survival of this virus, and very few data are currently available. The use of surrogate viruses to overcome these challenges and expand the available data on coronavirus survival and persistence in water was the focus of this study.

Considerable overlap can exist among the clinical signs of gastrointestinal and urinary tract disease. Colic and diarrhea can be seen in diseases of both systems, and ultrasound can help distinguish between gastrointestinal and urinary tract disease. Transitioning of the urogenital system from fetal to postnatal life at the time of birth involves abrupt changes in the umbilical remnant structures, as blood flow ceases entering and exiting the body through the umbilical cord and the roles of urine formation and handling are transferred from the placenta to the foal's organs. The umbilical cord should rupture cleanly a short distance from the foal's abdominal wall, leaving a 1 00 to 2 00 stump, 41 at which time the vascular structures inside the cord immediately contract and begin occluding further blood flow. Inside the umbilical cord are 4 clinically important structures that can be assessed sonographically: 2 umbilical arteries, 1 umbilical vein, and the urachus. In gestation, these structures are anatomically independent, but are bundled into a cord by an outer adventitial covering.

Global eradication is technically possible for any pathogen that is restricted to replicate or reproduce only in humans; however, this theory has one serious constraint in its feasibility. In order to effectively elim-inate any pathogen restricted to a human reservoir, it is crucial to get vaccination coverage as high as possible [77] -the fewer unvaccinated people in a community, the less chance for the pathogen to spread from person to person.

Our single-labeling experiments suggest that sustentacular cells contain most of the ACE2 protein in the OE, consistent with RNAseq data showing that neuronal expression of ACE2 is unlikely. The non-neuronal expression of ACE2 is not surprising, since transcriptome data for cerebral cortex indicated that ACE2 was expressed mostly by endothelial cells and astrocytes, but not by neurons. 22 However, others reported that ACE2 is also distributed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies. 23, 24 In order to clarify whether ACE2 protein is present in dendrites and cilia of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), we performed double labeling experiments with a marker for mature ORNs, olfactory marker protein (OMP). Double labeling shows that the majority of ACE2 signal is located within the layer of sustentacular cells, adjacent to the OMP signal, just below the heavily OMP-labeled ORN knobs and Figure 4A , B, D and E, F, H). Although it is possible that rare microvillar cells also express ACE2, we conclude that, in the OE, ACE2 protein is located mainly in the sustentacular cells but not in the ORN cilia. This finding is significant, because sustentacular cells are exposed to a hostile external environment and thus they are accessible to airborne pathogens including viruses. Sustentacular cells support ORN function by releasing odor-binding proteins and endocytosing olfactory binding protein−odorant complexes 25 and therefore may compromise olfaction when infected by viruses. In the olfactory bulb, ACE2 was localized mostly in mitral cells, and no or very low signal was detected in glomeruli or periglomerular interneurons ( Figure 4I−L) . Intriguingly, some dendritic localization of ACE2 was visible in mitral cells ( Figure 4I , L). This suggests that some distinct neuronal populations in the brain may contain ACE2, as was earlier observed by others. 22, 23 Recent RNAseq studies of respiratory epithelium in the human nasal cavity did not detect clear ACE2 signals, 16, 26 while single cell RNAseq in human respiratory epithelium did show ACE2 expression. 17 We detected ACE2 protein in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity, however, with a Figure 5E ). To localize TMPRSS2 expression in the OE, we used in situ hybridization, because available antibodies produced high background label. As shown in Figure 5H −J, TMPRSS2 transcripts were present in the sustentacular cells and also in deeper layers of the OE, which includes immature ORNs and stem cells, but label was low or nonexistent in mature ORNs. This localization clarifies previous controversies about TMPRSS2 expression in the OE, 10−12,14,18 by confirming low expression in mature ORNs. 18 TMPRSS2 expression in deeper layers of the OE is consistent with some of the RNAseq studies. 10, 11, 18 In summary, our mouse model shows that, with older age, amounts of ACE2 protein increase in the OE, as does gene expression of TMPRSS2, the two SARS-CoV-2 host receptors. This may explain why animals (and humans) are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection when they reach old age. 27 In mice, we have identified the sustentacular cells as the cell type in the OE which expresses both SARS-CoV-2 host receptors required for cell entry. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus accumulates in sustentacular cells first and, by interfering with their metabolism, affects the function of olfactory receptor neurons. The damage to these cells caused by the virus may impair smell sensation as is often observed in COVID-19 patients. Whether the virus may be transferred from sustentacular cells to olfactory receptor neurons requires further studies. The dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons are enwrapped by sustentacular cells, and such contacts may engage in cross-communication by exosomes. 28 Herpes viruses can hijack host exosomes to infect neighboring cells. 29 Therefore, further investigations are needed to verify the sustentacular cells as a primary SARS-CoV-2 target in the human OE and to examine whether the virus can pass from sustentacular cells to olfactory neurons with a potential route to infect the brain. An additional important finding of our work is that the murine OE contains a more intense accumulation of ACE2 protein than the respiratory epithelium. If this is true for the human OE, then the OE (and specifically the sustentacular cells) rather than the respiratory epithelium may be most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for this reason it may be the most relevant source of tissues to detect COVID-19 infection in early stages and in asymptomatic carriers. This could reduce the rate of false negative tests in early and in asymptomatic cases of COVID-19.

The control of the route of transmission is another effective means of epidemic control. Infections of healthcare workers and family clusters suggest that 2019-nCoV has the ability to spread from human to human. Although the seafood market has been closed, the number of confirmed cases continues to gradually increase ( Fig. 1 B) . This further supports the conclusion that this virus can spread by human-to-human contact. Previous research has shown that coronaviruses usually have an ability to rapidly mutate. 9 We cannot exclude the possibility that some 2019-nCoVs will mutate to become "super-spreaders", as seen in SARS. Frequent disinfection of people-intensive places and animal trading markets should help stop the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, the outbreak has cast a shadow over the celebrations for the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25. Millions of people in China travel over the course of the Spring Festival, both within the country and overseas. In addition, millions of college students (Wuhan has more than 1 million college students) will return to school after the winter vacation. This large-scale population migration could lead to further spread of this virus. Therefore, it is possible that this epidemic will be more serious after the Spring Festival. At present, the National Health Commission of China ( http://www.nhc.gov.cn ) has listed 2019-nCoV as Class B infectious disease and managed as Class A. Measures including the temperature monitoring of passengers at railway stations, airports, terminals and other transportation hubs have been carried out, which should slow the spread of the virus to a certain extent. However these disease control policies are far from enough, more strict methods to control population flow should be on the table.

This study has examined the properties of autophagosomes induced by coronavirus NSP6 proteins. Autophagosomes were identified by immunostaining for endogenous MAP1LC3B, or by analysis of GFP-MAP1LC3B puncta. Pixel densities obtained from fluorescence images were rendered allowing a statistical comparison with autophagosomes formed in response to starvation. Cells expressing NSP6 proteins contained significantly larger number of autophagosomes (= 54, σ = 15.07) when compared with cells starved in HBSS, however, the autophagosomes induced by NSP6 were significantly smaller in diameter (= 0.48 µm, σ = 0.11) compared with starvation controls (= 0.85 µm, σ = 0.22). At first this suggested that NSP6 proteins had an Figure 4 (See previous page) . effect of iBV NsP6 on maturation of omegasomes. Vero cells were transferred from nutrient media to hBss and fixed at the indicated times. Omegasomes were visualized by immunofluorescence staining for endogenous WiPi2. Pixel densities in fluorescent images were analyzed in imaris using spot function to generate rendered images presented below the corresponding fluorescent images (the images are projections made of 9 z slices 300 nm apart). The diameters of WiPi2 puncta were color coded using a heat map red puncta are 1.0 µm or greater.

Like SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is also caused by a coronavirus. 21 The first cases were reported in Saudi Arabia in the fall of 2012, but cases had occurred in Jordan earlier that year. All cases of MERS to date have been linked through travel to or residence in countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. The largest known outbreak of MERS outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015 and was associated with a traveler returning from the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-Corona virus (Co-V) spreads from ill people to others via close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person, and patients have ranged in age from infants to nonagenarians. Unfortunately, the detailed histopathology of patients with MERS has not been reported but is likely to resemble that due to other coronaviruses.

In December 2019, COVID-19 erupted in Wuhan, China, and spread quickly across the country. More than 80 000 people were infected, and 4000 over people were killed by the disease, so the crisis event has become the largest public health emergency in China. The Chinese government continuously revised and issued programs to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic to reduce the mortality rate. 1, 2 Early studies showed that both COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic virus carriers could transmit from person to person. 3 The incubation period was 1 to 14 days, and the median incubation period was 4 days, 4 which had impact on the rapid spread of COVID-19 virus. More than 40 000 medical staff (nurses and doctors) volunteered to fight against the spread of the COVID-19 by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with infectious disease prevention and control requirements. 5, 6 According to the guidance from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 6 medical staff should wear different levels of PPE according to different exposure risks. The level 2 PPE included surgical masks with goggles or face masks, and protective gowns, which were mainly used to protect staff with moderaterisk exposure positions where suspected patients were managed in emergency departments and screening clinics. The level 2 PPE characterised relatively closure with a small amount of moisture ( Figure 1 ). The level 3 PPE included N95/KN95 respirators with goggles or face masks, and protective gowns, latex gloves, and shoes, which were mainly used to protect staff with high-risk exposure positions in the infectious disease department, intensive care units (ICUs), and isolation wards where COVID-19 patients were treated. The level 3 PPE characterised absolutely closure, thick, and heavy and easily cause perspiration ( Figure 2 ).

The finding that assembly of HBsAg dimers into the secreted lipoprotein particle occurs in an intermediate compartrnent between the ER and the Golgi ascribes a new role to this compartment in biosynthesis. Saraste and Kuismanen (1984) first identified this compartment by showing that at 15~ the transport of viral membrane glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi complex in BHK cells was blocked reversibly. The protein could leave the ER but failed to enter the Golgi, accumulating in a tubulovesicular compartment distinct from the ER and the Golgi. An important and, to many workers, defining function is the retrieval of the soluble resident ER proteins containing the KDEL retention sequence at their carboxy termini, such as PDI and BiP (Munro and Pelham, 1987) . Munro and Pelham (1987) hypothesized the existence of a salvage compartment from which escaped KDEL terminated proteins could be retrieved by recycling to the ER. Since the extensive disulphide crosslinking is a consequence of the exclusion of PDI it is likely that the compartment in which oligomer crosslinks form is either identical to or later than the salvage compartment. We have also shown here that rab2, an established marker of an intermediate compartment (Chavier et al., 1990) is found in the HBsAg enriched, PDI excluding regions. This salvage compartment has been proposed to be the same as the 15~ compartment (Lippincott-Schwartz, 1990; Pelham, 1988 Pelham, , 1989 Vaux et al., 1990 , Warren, 1987 , although colocalization with a viral glycoprotein under conditions of 15~ block has not yet been published. Although a number of authors refer to "the" ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, the diversity of functions that have been attributed to it open the possibility that this compartment is heterogeneous. An ER-Golgi intermediate compartment has been identified as the site of the interaction of MHC class I with antigen (Cox et al., 1989; Nuchtern et al., 1989; Yewdell et al., 1989) , and several proteins including p53 and p58, two transmembrane proteins of still unknown function (Schweizer et al., 1988; Saraste and Svensson, 1991) , have been localized to it. Tooze et al. (1988) showed that the first step of the O-glycosylation of a coronavirus glycoprotein, the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine, occurred in the same ER-Golgi intermediate compartment as budding of viral particles. Palmitoylation of proteins (Bonatti et al., 1989 ) and the initial step in the formation of the lysosomal mannose-6-phosphate targeting signal, the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-l-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine-l-phosphate to newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes have also been shown to occur in a post-ER pre-Golgi compartment (Rizzolo et al., 1985; Kornfeld, 1988, Komfeld and Mellman, 1989; Lazzarino and Gabel, 1988; Pelham, 1988) . Recent work shows that these functions may be in distinct compartments between the ER and the Golgi complex. Schweizer et al. (1991) isolated a fraction from Veto cells that is enriched in p53 and has properties different from either the ER or the cis-Golgi. Further, Bonatti et al. (1989) demonstrated that protein palmitoylation occurs in a compartrnent which is later than the 15~ block but before mannosidase I trimming of glycans. We are pursuing experiments to further characterize the compartment which is involved in the maturation of HBsAg lipoprotein particles and to relate it to other markers of this region.

Astroviruses or adenoviruses exhibited shorter survival time than rotaviruses and HAV. Despite this, they were able to survive on inert surfaces long enough to suggest that contaminated surfaces may have a relevant role in the secondary transmission of these viruses (Abad et al. 2001 ). Information about the survival of HEV in environment is still lacking. Respiratory viral infections are a major health burden (Winther et al. 2006) . Although these diseases are often regarded as trivial, hospital admission and mortality rates in infant or elderly are considerable. For instance, respiratory viruses cause more than 400,000 hospitalizations per year in children less than 18 years of age in the United States (Henrickson et al. 2004 ). Viral agents that primarily infect the upper or lower respiratory tract include influenza and parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses (Kesson 2007) . It is generally accepted that respiratory viruses are spread from person to person by aerosol transmission due to sneezing or coughing (Goldmann 2000) . Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of flu viruses and other respiratory viruses are spread via contaminated hands and fomites (Hall et al. 1980; Tiwari et al. 2006; Winther et al. 2007) .

Another novel human coronavirus, MERS-CoV was isolated from a patient with acute pneumonia in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. As of March 2015, MERS-CoV infection has led to 1084 cases and 439 deaths reported in multiple countries. The fatality of MERS-CoV is considerably higher than SARS-CoV, approaching 30%. MERS-CoV may be originating from bats due to its high sequence homology to the bat virus. It is speculated the virus spreads from bats to human via dromedary camel (Fig. 21.11 ). Almost all cases have been linked to Saudi Arabia. Although human-to-human transmission seems to be inefficient, it has been shown to spread between people who are in close contact.

No release/aggregation of virus particles is observed when NA activity is blocked [35, 118] , showing the crucial function of NA in producing infectious progeny. NA sialidase activity is probably not required at the site of particle assembly per se, but expression of NA rather results in a cell surface devoid of sialosides, which also prevents superinfection [119] . Subsequent spreading of an infection differs from a primary infection in particle numbers (much higher [120] ) and location (directly at the epithelial cell surface) and may have a different requirement for the HA-NA-receptor balance. Particles that are assembled are often spherical, but those of clinical isolates may also be filamentous (reviewed in [87, 121] ). Very long filamentous particles are particularly easily observed when they are cell-associated ( [121] and references therein), but may be more labile than spherical particles when released from cells [122] . The filamentous particle phenotype is lost upon passaging in vitro, mostly resulting from mutations in M1, while this phenotype is maintained or may even be regained upon passaging in vivo [87, 123] , thereby suggesting an important, yet to be established, role for such particles in vivo. Filamentous particles may serve to efficiently spread from cell to cell when these cells are covered with a mucus layer. Alternatively, filamentous particles may be able to penetrate the mucus layer towards the luminal side and thereby be important for transmission. Of note, association of virus particles with mucus was shown to enhance particle stability in aerosols, and thereby transmissibility [124, 125] . Likely, there is also an important role for the HA-NA-receptor balance in this respect, as, before infecting a new host, virus particles need to dissociate from these mucus molecules.

Another feature of COVID-19 common to SARS and MERS is the rapidity of global spread due to commercial air travel. The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic took months to spread from Europe to Australia or South America as ship-borne travel took time. Modern air travel allows passengers to traverse the globe in less than a day. This allows the viruses to rapidly spread across continents, and efforts at airport screening to halt them have been fairly ineffective and costly. 5, 6 This is in addition to the potential for in-flight transmission of the virus among passengers that was observed with SARS. 7 Once the pathogen has landed in a new country, the likelihood of contagion and spread is dependent on local transmission pathways and the strength of local health protection systems. Experience from MERS suggests the transmissibility of the virus is not just due to its inherent infectivity but also due to influence by local contextual variables such as hygiene practices, crowding, and infection control standards. 8 High-income countries such as the United States and United Kingdom have well-developed health protection systems to detect and respond to communicable disease threats. They have the ability to robustly trace contacts, assess suspected cases, and have them tested rapidly to get timely laboratory confirmation of infectious status to guide the management of these individuals. Infected individuals identified can then be isolated until the risk of disease transmission has abated. This containment strategy, however, is resource intensive and may be more difficult to enforce in liberal democracies.

Most patients suffering with sinus symptoms will have a viral etiology of their inflammation [8] . It can be quite difficult for a primary care physician to distinguish between simple upper respiratory infections (URI), episodes of acute viral rhinosinusitis (AVRS), and episodes of true bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). Almost 90% of patients with viral URIs have evidence of AVRS [9] . The most common viruses that cause VRS are rhinovirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus; others include parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and metapneumovirus [10] . Patients with AVRS typically develop symptoms 1-4 days after infection. Viruses attach to the nasal epithelium and can spread from the nasal cavity to the paranasal sinuses. Once within the paranasal sinuses, viruses may exert direct toxic effects on mucociliary clearance, and may induce epithelial permeability and hypersecretion from inflammatory cytokines. These alterations lead to the mucosal edema, thickened secretions, and ostial obstruction characteristic of acute rhinosinusitis.

The design principle for integrating a mechanical sample homogenizer with TruTip nucleic acid purification is described elsewhere [33] . Briefly, the concept involves separating the consumable from the energy-transducing mechanism-in this case, a rotating cylindrical magnet that is external to the lysis tubes (or reagent plate). At high rotational speeds, the external magnet induces the rotation of a small magnetic stir disc inside of each lysis tube, which in turn agitates the solid particles. Particle agitation is controlled by adjusting the speed of the external, rotating magnet. Magnetically-induced vortexing (MagVor) therefore generates a chaotic bead-milling or bead beating effect within the sample using simple hardware components and with minimal heat generated in the solution. Adjacent to the rotating magnet is a motorized carriage with integrated heater that holds all consumables for the extraction including sample lysis tubes, heater tubes, and a 96-well reagent plate. The carriage controls the position of the consumables relative to a fixed-position, 8-channel, custom-built pipetting manifold. The pipetting manifold (with attached TruTips) moves vertically up and down and a positive-displacement syringe pump controls the speed and aspiration/dispense volumes across all eight tips simultaneously. Pipetting speed is used as a proxy and means for controlling flow rate through the TruTip matrix. A selection valve and small air pump control air flow to the individual tips to dry the silica binding matrix after wash steps and before nucleic acid elution. Biosafety concerns were (partially) addressed in the prototype workstation by incorporating a HEPA-filtered exhaust fan and enclosure around the moving parts and consumables, creating a negative pressure air box relative to the operating environment. Electronic components were protected from potential liquid splashes by protective covers that can be wiped down with bleach or other disinfectants. The prototype was also designed to fit within a standard Biosafety cabinet if needed or desired. The synergistic, positive impact of integrated bead milling on nucleic acid recovery is summarized in Table 2 , where DNA yield at least doubled (> 1 ΔC t ) at cell inputs ! 10 3 CFU mL -1 (p < 0.05) and M. tuberculosis dilutions [at 100% extraction and detection efficiency, a 1 C t difference represents a 100% increase in recovered DNA]. The data also show that the extra offline enzymatic liquefaction step is not required for efficient DNA extraction, but was retained for all subsequent experiments because it simplified the transfer of a precise sputum volume from the primary sample container to the automated system lysis tubes. Given the heterogenous nature of individual sputum samples and an inability to accurately split a primary sputum sample, we were unable to determine the relative effect of MagVor alone on native (nonspiked) specimens.

Although many scientists believe that bats are the intermediate host, most species of bats live in tropical or subtropical rain forests and caves far from human populations, thus the probability of bats transmitting the virus directly to humans is unlikely. It is generally known that bats may spread viruses to other intermediate hosts such as wild animals or livestock, from which the viruses are then transmitted to humans. Ji et al. carried out a comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage bias among different animal species based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence [13] . The result suggested that SARS-CoV-2 appeared to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and a coronavirus of unknown origin. They considered that snake was a most probable wildlife animal reservoir, but the conclusion was controversial. Guo et al. introduced VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses by deep learning algorithm and predicted that bat coronaviruses were assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with SARS-CoV-2 [14] . The results illustrated that bat and mink might be two candidate reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. Lam et al. identified pangolinassociated coronaviruses belonging to two sublineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD by metagenomic sequencing [15] . Hence, pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts and should be removed from markets to prevent such zoonotic transmission.

Serology can aid diagnosis. 60 Recognition of Toxoplasma in an adult cat should instigate investigations to determine a cause of immune suppression, which is often FIV related 50,78 but can be iatrogenic (e.g., due to administration of corticosteroids or cyclosporin). 14,77 Treatment is covered in detail in Chapter 23 but is typically with clindamycin at 12.5 to 25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 2 weeks 60 ; combination therapy with pyrimethamine at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours may help the prognosis. 14 Supportive care such as oxygen therapy maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is also important.

Therefore a prerequisite for heartworm infection is a climate with adequate temperature and humidity to support a viable mosquito population and allow maturation of larvae within the intermediate host. The sexually dimorphic adult heartworm mate within an infected dog's pulmonary artery, producing immature forms called microfilariae. Circulating microfilariae are ingested by mosquitoes feeding on infected dogs. Within mosquitoes, microfilariae transform into larval stages. There are five larval stages (L1 to L5); L1 to L3 transformations occur within the mosquito, and L3 is the form that is transmitted from mosquitos to dogs and cats. Maturation from L3 to other larval stages occurs in subcutaneous tissues and peripheral veins of mammalian hosts; immature worms in peripheral veins are carried in the bloodstream to and through the heart, with adult heartworms ultimately residing at the caudal pulmonary arteries. 1 There are significant differences between feline and canine heartworm disease because the parasite is only partially adapted to the cat. The cat is susceptible to heartworm infection but more resistant than the dog. The cat represents a dead-end host because it cannot act as a reservoir for infection. The prepatent period in the cat is 7 to 8 months (1 to 2 months longer than in dogs). 169 In dogs, most juvenile worms mature into adults that can live for 5 to 7 years, whereas in cats most juvenile worms die shortly after arriving in the pulmonary arteries, instigating a severe vascular and parenchymal inflammatory response. Pulmonary lesions may be long lasting. The clinical response in the cat has been termed heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD).

There is limited evidence that one of these (229E) may be vertically transmitted from mothers to infants, although the mechanism remains unclear.30 The presence of 229E in neonatal gastric samples suggests that one possible mechanism for infection is through human milk, although this study30 did not specifically evaluate the presence of 229E in human milk.

The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus first described in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. 1 Humans may become infected through contact with contaminated respiratory secretions from infected patients or animals (mainly dromedaries). Although human-tohuman transmission of the virus is low, MERS-CoV has been known to spread from ill people to others through close contact such as caring for or living with an infected person. Thus, transmission of MERS-CoV is more likely to occur in healthcare facilities, 2 with most of the cases reported having been associated with nosocomial outbreaks. 3 As of July 2017, 2040 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to the World Health Organization. To date, all cases of MERS have been linked to travel or residence in countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, exported cases 3 and outbreaks 2 outside the Arabian Peninsula have also been shown. The clinical syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death, with a case fatality rate of~35%. 4, 5 To achieve early detection and avoid the transmission of the virus, suspicion of MERS-CoV should be raised whenever there are compatible clinical symptoms (acute febrile respiratory illness) and an epidemiological link (person resides or has travelled within a 14-day period before symptom initiation to the Middle East or any of the countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred). 6 In addition, adequate measures of infection prevention and control should be taken until MERS-CoV infection is ruled out. Initial symptoms of MERS-COV are non-specific and may resemble those of other respiratory agents. Having an accurate and early microbiological diagnosis without delaying MERS-CoV testing seems reasonable to improve patient management. In this study we evaluated the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the patients with suspicion of MERS-CoV attended in our centre and the definitive respiratory aetiology identified through a comprehensive panel test.

Medical specialties involve various examinations that may put patients and practitioners at risk of infection. Ophthalmic instruments may act as medium for viral transmission and ophthalmic healthcare facilities pose a risk of cross infection. 2, 3 A recent review suggested that as coronaviruses are able to develop a wide range of ocular manifestations; thus, ophthalmologists should be cautious to prevent possible transmission through ocular tissue. 4 Cases of conjunctivitis have been reported in COVID-19 patients. 5, 6 In one report, 2 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay of conjunctival secretions. 5 Moreover, the nasolacrimal duct may act as a pathway to transfer the virus from the eye to the nasopharynx. 7 Here, we address the prevention strategies employed against COVID-19 according to assessments of infection control experts and ophthalmologists, in Amiralmomenin Hospital a tertiary referral eye hospital in Guilan, Iran. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second report to describe the actions employed in an ophthalmology hospital setting. 8 At our institution preventive measures were applied in 3 main aspects outlined below.

G6PD deficiency POC test permits clinical diagnostic decisions either to administer anti-malarial drugs/SP or not in resource-limited settings and useful for improving health outcomes and the cost of accessing G6PD testing services. Spatial analysis estimated current mean distance and travel to a G6PD deficiency testing center from all locations in UER to be over 33 km and 60 min respectively using a motorized tricycle. This could be reduced significantly with the implementation of POC testing for G6PD deficiency at PHC clinics located more than 10 km away from a health facility. Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries. To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria endemic countries.

It is an important enzyme in the sumoylation pathway. hUbc9 catalyzes the modification of target proteins by covalent addition of a small ubiquitin-like modifier known as SUMO-1. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification process of proteins involving the formation of an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of SUMO-1 and a lysine side chain of the target protein. The SUMO-1 pathway involves ATP-dependent SUMO-1 activation catalyzed by the heterodimeric SUMO-1 activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2). This is followed by transfer of SUMO-1 to the SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme hUbc9 in a transesterification reaction and the final transfer of SUMO-1 from the SUMO-1-Ubc9 complex to the target protein. Unlike ubiquitination, sumoylation does not cause protein degradation, but has been implicated in other cellular processes such as regulating the activity of transcription factors, mediating protein-protein interaction, enhancing protein stability and nuclear and cytoplasm trafficking [Muller et al., 2001; Seeler and Dejean, 2003] . Many viral proteins can interact with hUbc9 and sumoylated, which is important for virus replication [Rangasamy and Wilson, 2000; Lee et al., 2003; Maeda et al., 2003; Weldon et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2004; Gurer et al., 2005] . So far it seems that most of the viral proteins binding to hUbc9 are capsid proteins involved in virus genome binding and replication.

A framework for identifying regional outbreak and spread of COVID-19 from one-minute population-wide surveys To the Editor -In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was isolated, after a cluster of patients in China were diagnosed with pneumonia of unknown cause 1 . This new isolate was named 'SARS-CoV-2' and is the cause of the disease COVID-19. The virus has led to an ongoing outbreak and an unprecedented international health crisis. The number of infected people is rapidly increasing globally 2 and most probably is a vast underestimation of the real number of patients worldwide, as infected people are contagious even when minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic 3 . The spread of the disease has presented an extreme challenge to the international community, and policy-makers from different countries have each chosen different strategies, depending on the local spread of the virus, healthcare-system resources, economic and political factors, public adherence, and their perception of the situation.

In laboratory animals the first few weeks of life are a period of very rapid physiological change. For example, during this time mice pass from a stage of immunological nonreactivity (to many antigens) to immunological maturity. This change profoundly affects their reaction to viruses like lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which induces a per sistent tolerated infection when inoculated into newborn mice, but an immune response in mice infected when over a week old. Most domes tic animals are reasonably mature immunologically at the time of birth, but still very susceptible to infection with those viruses against which their dam has no antibody. If the umbrella of maternal antibody usually provided in mammals through colostrum or transplacental transfer is missing, the newborn animal is particularly vulnerable to infections with viruses such as canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, hog cholera virus, bovine virus diarrhea virus, enteropathogenic coronaviruses, ro ta viruses, and various herpesviruses during the first few weeks of life.

In areas where white-tailed deer and meningeal worm are endemic, meningeal worm prophylaxis with monthly, parenteral administration of avermectins has been recommended. 7 Documentation of the development of anthelminthic resistance because of meningeal worm prophylaxis has led some farms to pursue drug-free meningeal worm prophylaxis, which may be instituted when designing housing and husbandry recommendations. Meningeal worm is transmitted from white-tailed deer to camelids through arboreal snails. [7] [8] [9] As such, deer-proof fencing, introduction of guinea fowl, and the use of molluscicides can minimize transmission. Removal of organic matter, in the form of leaf or wood piles, and establishment of pasture perimeters using limestone or gravel also inhibits snail and slug habitation in camelid pastures. 10 More complete assessments of parasite control measures are covered in the articles ''Gastrointestinal Parasitology'' by Ballweber and ''Neurological Diseases'' by Whitehead and Bedenice elsewhere in this issue.

Epidemiological human and animal investigations are required to find and identify the animal reservoir(s) that either directly or indirectly transmits the virus occasionally to humans. Researchers confirmed that the virus was being transmitted from person to person in multiple clusters of MERS-CoV infection. An active surveillance for clusters of cases of severe respiratory disease must be a priority, especially among health care workers. Such surveillance should include the rapid diagnosis and stringent infection control measures for suspected or confirmed human infections. Extensive serological testing of potentially exposed human populations and contacts will be a key indicator of the extent of infection and disease due to novel coronaviruses. General supportive care continues to be the keystone for managing patients who have an acute respiratory failure and a septic shock as a consequence of severe infections. It is difficult to make predictions regarding the future of MERS-CoV, but the following two scenarios are possible in the future: First, the current pattern of ongoing cases could continue, and , the virus could die out and go away similar to SARS-CoV, or second, there could be a change in the transmission pattern leading to more outbreaks and a pandemic. The establishment of a convalescent plasma bank, development of an effective vaccine, and design of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials to test potential specific antiviral agents are all urgently needed.

Dear Editor, since December 2019, cases of SARS-CoV-2-related disease, now known as COVID-19, have rapidly spread from the Hubei province of China to the whole world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially recognised COVID-19 as a pandemic and Countries worldwide are now facing huge challenges trying to further prevent its spread and treating the growing number of positive patients. In fact, although the majority of cases are usually self-limiting with mild symptoms such as low-grade fever and cough, the diseases can be deadly [1] . Serious cases of COVID-19 can develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failures leading to death; the mortality rate is much higher in elder patients with pre-existing chronic diseases [1] . Clinicians are searching for a reliable prognostic marker that can distinguish patients at risk of developing more severe forms of disease, in order to better manage hospital resources. The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) in peripheral blood has been studied as a systemic inflammatory marker and various works have shown that it is a valid prognostic factor in various solid tumors [3] and other chronic diseases, such as lung, cardiovascular and kidney diseases. In our work we described the clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and aimed to assess predictors of clinical outcomes.

In early December 2019, the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The pathogen has been identified as a novel β‐coronavirus by full‐genome sequencing and is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) which shares phylogenetic similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) that caused the outbreak of SARS in 2003 (Luk et al, 2019; preprint: Guan et al, 2020; Zhou et al, 2020a). Disease caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, which has been highly contagious and spread rapidly nationwide and worldwide, has been designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) by World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemic curves of COVID‐19 reflected what might be a mixed outbreak pattern, with the early cases suggested a continuous common source, while the later cases suggested a propagated source as the virus began to be transmitted from person to person (Wu & McGoogan, 2020). Most cases are mild to moderate and curable, and the overall crude mortality rate is low (preprint: Guan et al, 2020). However, a proportion of patients with severe disease characterized by respiratory dysfunction have shown a high mortality rate (preprint: Guan et al, 2020; Yang et al, 2020). By February 16, 2020, a total number of 57,934 cases have been reported in mainland China, including 10,644 severe cases. As the outbreak area of COVID‐19, the total number of confirmed cases in Hubei is 49,847, with 9,797 (19.6%) severe cases and an overall mortality rate of 3.4%. The disease incidence and mortality rate of severe COVID‐19 in Hubei is relatively high as compared with other areas in China.

One would expect that a virus such as PEDV, which replicates to very high titers in swine and which can easily and rapidly spread from one swine farm to another, would be able to maintain itself in the swine population. As previously explained, once an outbreak has occurred on a breeding farm, PEDV virus could persist easily when successive litters of pigs, after losing their lactogenic protection at weaning, become a susceptible target for infection. In fact, persistence for a virus such as PEDV would be almost as a "natural" feature similar to the endemic character observed with other porcine enzootic enteric viruses such as swine rotaviruses, swine enteroviruses and others. TGEV cannot serve as an example here because, in Europe, it has largely been eliminated from the swine population due to the emergence, in the early eighties, of the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is a TGEV deletion mutant which has acquired respiratory tropism and shows an epidemiological advantage of rapid aerogenic spreading while causing a protective immunity to TGEV. Endemic PRCV has thus "replaced" TGEV in Europe.

This increase in cases can be attributed to the increased mobility of infections over larger distances enabled by the few human agents still moving across the population in partial lockdowns, while also preserving the mosquitoes' advantage in being able to infect more humans. This result suggests that additional care must be taken to see that essential workers who continue to be mobile in lockdowns do not carry mosquito-borne diseases, and that others who may carry such infections are not allowed to move around. We further analyzed how the impact of lockdowns varies across three mosquito-borne diseases: chikungunya, dengue and malaria. We found that dengue outbreaks are more severe than chikungunya in any situation even though they share the same vector, Aedes Aegypti. This is because the dengue virus is transmissible from humans to mosquitoes even during late intrinsic incubation stage and early recovered stage. This in turn allows movement of infections by means of humans who are infectious but not showing symptoms (ironically in a manner similar to COVID-19). We also observed that the effects of lockdowns are less pronounced on malaria outbreaks, as they are spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes which are generally active during the night, a time where most humans are stationary with or without lockdowns.

To determine the spectrum of disease and clinical impact of community acquired West Nile infection and assess public health behavior patterns in transplant recipients, we carried out a seroprevalence study in this patient population. Methods: Patients were enrolled primarily from outpatient transplant clinics and the transplant inpatient ward. Patients who had not left hospital since transplant were excluded. Sera were initially screened for antibodies to West Nile virus by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. HI reactive sera were then tested using a West Nile virus IgM ELISA and a plaque reduction neutralization test. A questionnaire was provided to patients to assess knowledge and behavior patterns with regards to West Nile virus. Results: 855 organ transplant patients were enrolled. Type of transplant included kidney (n=419), liver (n=204), lung (n=94), heart (n=83), pancreas (n=46) and others (n=9). Median time from transplant was 50.6 months (range 2 weeks -410 months). The seroprevalence of IgM antibody to West Nile was 6/855 (0.7%). One patient had IgG antibody alone and likely had remote infection. All 6 patients (100%) had symptomatic disease, and 5/6 (83%) had meningitis, encephalitis, and/or acute flaccid paralysis. The knowledge among patients concerning the risk of West Nile virus infection was incomplete, and behavior patterns reflected a poor rate of compliance. Only 56% knew of at least one protective measure and only 44% had acted on at least one protective measure. Only 33% of patients used insect repellant when outdoors. Conclusions: Community acquired West Nile virus is an important threat to transplant patients. The rate of severe neurological disease is much higher than reported in the general population. Education regarding personal protection measures is critical in these patients. However, despite high public awareness of West Nile virus, and specific educational attempts by the transplant program, incomplete knowledge and poor rates of compliance were reported. Amongst the 9 patients with solid organ transplants infected with West Nile virus reported thus far in literature (see Table) , 8 developed encephalitis and 2 died. This is alarming compared to the less than 1% incidence of serious neurological manifestations and 2% mortality in the general population. Over the past year, we treated 3 solid organ recipients who developed West Nile fever on long-term follow-up (see Table) . They included a 44-year-old male (kidney-pancreas), a 37-year-old female (pancreas) and a 2½-year-old (living donor kidney). Their immunosuppression is detailed in below. Two of them developed serious meningoencephalitis requiring ventilator support for up to a week. The management strategy included prompt reduction of immunosuppression and supportive care. The fever subsided over a week in all patients, but the neurological recovery was slower. The child recovered to near normalcy in two weeks and was discharged home. In contrast, the adult male who developed encephalitis has significant neurological sequelae and is undergoing rehabilitation. Immunosuppression was restored upon recovery in all. Transplant physicians, particularly in West Nile virus endemic areas, must be alive to the possibility of West Nile fever in their patients developing fever in the summer months. Prompt reduction of immunosuppression is probably the most vital step in the successful management of these patients. During this outbreak, we encountered both MENC and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) due to community-acquired WNV disease in our otherwise stable population of transplant recipients. Design/Methods: 10 transplant recipients (4 renal, 1 renal/ pancreas, 2 liver, 1 lung, 1 bone marrow) were hospitalized with severe WNV infection documented by WNV IgM in CSF or serum. Clinical features, diagnostic and laboratory studies including CSF examination, neuroimaging, EEG, EMG/NCV, and neuropathology were characterized. Results: Estimated incidence of MENC+AFP due to WNV virus infection in Colorado was .014% for the general population of approximately 4 million, and .250% for the approximately 4000 transplant recipients in the state. All patients acquired infection in the community, none had history of recent (<3 mos) transfusions, and all received their transplants 8 mos-15 yrs prior to WNV infection and were on maintenance immunosuppression. 9 of 10 patients had MENC and 3 had associated AFP with quadriparesis. One case had AFP alone. All AFP cases required at least transient mechanical ventilation. CSF examination demonstrated pleocytosis (10/10, counts ranged between 5-5400), elevated protein (10/10), and lymphocytic predominance (9/10). Brain MRIs demonstrated abnormalities of white matter (7/8) and thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstem (3/8) . EEGs were abnormal (7/ 7) and showed generalized slowing (7/7), triphasic slow waves (2/7), and PLEDs (2/ 7). 3 patients had seizures. Neuropathology of our fatal case demonstrated multifocal necrosis in thalami, s. nigra, pons, cerebellum and anterior spinal cord. Management strategies included reduction in immunosuppression and use of interferon (6), standard IV Ig (4), WNV IV Ig (2), and ribavirin (1) Background: SARS is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). During the worldwide SARS epidemic, two transplant patients developed infection at our center. SARS posed several problems unique to transplantation. First, transplant patients with SARS may have more severe disease with greater infectivity. Second, SARS could theoretically be transmitted from a donor to a recipient. To prevent the latter, a clinical SARS donor screening tool was implemented. We report a case of SARS and provide our experience with SARS screening. Methods: SARS CoV viral load was performed using RT-PCR on tissue obtained at post-mortem and compared to a cohort of non-transplant SARS patients (21 patients). The donor SARS screening tool was prospectively utilized and assessed during the outbreak.

Infectious viral diseases, both emerging, and re-emerging, pose a continuous health threat and disease burden to humans. In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of emerging virus disease outbreaks in human and animals alike with substantial health and economic impact. They are most likely related to accelerating environmental and anthropogenic changes, such as increased mobility and demographic changes, which alter the rate and nature of contact between animal and human populations. The influenza A viruses are probably the most notorious viruses which have shown their potential for repeated cross species transmission and pandemic potential (Claas et al., 1998; Koopmans, 2013; de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014; Bodewes et al., 2015) . Schmallenberg virus caused an outbreak in ruminants with major impact on international trade of susceptible animals and animal products such as semen and embryos with more than 15 countries imposing restrictions on imports of live cattle from the European Union (EU) . Lately, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus was causing renewed concern as it spread from the Middle East to the Republic of Korea with 186 confirmed human cases, including 36 deaths in July 2015 (http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-july-2015-mers-korea/en/). Ebola virus has fruit bats (Pteripodidae) as natural hosts and the current epidemic is thought to be introduced into the human population by zoonotic transmission (Marí Saíz et al., 2014) . Many of the most important human pathogens are either zoonotic or originated as zoonoses before adapting to humans (Taylor et al., 2001; Kuiken et al., 2005; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005; Cutler, 2010; Morse et al., 2012) and humanity is continuously being exposed to novel animal pathogens.

As ecologists, we view cities, towns, villages, neighborhoods, and homes as connected nodes on a socio-ecological network. A socio-ecological network consists of intertwined human-centric networks (e.g., a railway network, a public transit system, an air route network) and natural networks (e.g., a river, a conservation corridor, a bird migration route). While operating to primarily serve human needs, these component networks also benefit (or obstruct) other beings, including germs that are detrimental to human health. The coronavirus is only a most recent "beneficiary" of this kind. As such, the essence of the lockdown strategy is to lock down all the nodes on a socio-ecological network, preventing this deadly virus from transmitting from node to node. When strictly implemented, the strategy should work theoretically; in practice, it did work well in China this time.

Humans are nowadays very often in contact with pets or farm animals such as cattle, pigs, poultry, and horses. Although there are many infectious diseases typically found in people working with livestock, according to the microorganisms-driven genetic selection theory humans should have less to fear from livestock than from wild animals regarding the risk of deadly zoonotic diseases since they shared the same ecosystem with livestock for millennia. This does not mean humans should not remain vigilant (this is the reason why milk pasteurization exists and why meat must be cooked before consumption) and not worry about pathogens abnormally present in their livestock because of the interconnectedness of different ecosystems. Despite veterinary FIGURE 3 | Left panel: Pathogens flow at the human-livestock-wildlife interface. Many factors associated to this interaction network contribute to a trend toward the globalization of the distribution of pathogens: Ecosystems evolution, extensive agriculture, and water control projects, anarchic urbanization, migration of humans and animals, agroecology and livestock-wildlife interactions, spread of vectors, climate change, human behaviors, development of regional, and international transports. Right panel: NHP can be sometimes wildlife ecosystem actors and sometimes actors of the human ecosystem, especially when they are kept as pets. At the level of wild ecosystems, NHP are not the only source of pathogens, they are important players alongside other actors such as bats, rodents, or birds. When NHP come in close contact with humans as pets they can either directly transmit pathogens to humans or infect actors of the human ecosystem such as farm animals (livestock, cattle, poultry) or pets that can become intermediates in the transmission of pathogen to humans. Of course, most pathogens transmitted to humans by farm animals or pets do not originate from NHP. The figure summarizes examples of pathogens' transmitted from cattle, poultry, or pets to humans. The SARS-like bat CoV was transmitted to humans after evolution in the Himalayan palm-civet. The MERS-like bat CoV, originated in vespertilionid bats and evolved in dromedary prior to its transmission to human. The Hendra virus was passed from the Pteropus bat to horses, followed by transmission from horses to humans. Pteropus bats were also responsible for Nipah virus transmission to pigs which infected humans. In fact, bats are among the major reservoirs of viruses (including lyssavirus, filoviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses), and a threat because they are adapted to flight on long distances, thus dispatching pathogens to a larger area. For the same reasons of mobility over long distance, birds are also exquisitely adapted to carry pathogens (such as influenza viruses) to farm animals before being passed on to humans. Pigs play a role in the transmission of influenza A/H1N1 to humans. Transmission of A/H7N2 to humans by cats was reported. Poultry was involved in the transmission of A/H5N1 to humans. Viruses can also be transmitted in unconventional manners such as the West Nile virus, a vector-borne pathogen maintained in a bird-mosquito cycle that infects horses and contaminated a veterinarian during the brain autopsy of a horse, or a pig found carrying a rabies virus. Investigation of wounds of humans bitten by farm animals has often shown the presence of Actinobacillus lignieresii, A. suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Escherichia coli, and Pasteurella multocida among others. In the USA, dogs cause about 1,000,000 bite cases/year (Bic/y) and cats 400,000 Bic/y for 90 million pets. Infection rates was about 15% following dog bites and 40% following cat bites and almost half of the wounds were polymicrobial with aerobic and anaerobic organism. There is a specific concern for rabies transmission. Most deaths from rabies occur in India, Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia with a hotspot in Thailand were 10% of stray dog in Bangkok, are infected with rabies (compared to 1% in the US). Children have developed tularemia after contact with hamsters carrying Francisella tularensis. Guinea pig and rat pets could possibly spread Junin virus through their urine, feces and saliva. Cases of children bitten by rats infected by Leptospira were reported. The bites of monkeys kept as pet are also a source of concern. cares, these animals may serve as intermediate for transmission of wildlife-borne pathogens (including NHP-borne pathogens on rare occasions) to the livestock owners and thereby represent the main source of human infectious disease and pandemics (Figure 3 ). According to WHO (73), a zoonosis is any disease or infection that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans. Today, as was the case centuries ago, most EID in humans originate from zoonoses after hazardous events, the occurrence of which is impossible to predict (23) . EID can refer to different epidemiological situations: (i) the disease is caused by a newly identified pathogen and did not exist previously in humans (e.g., AIDS or SARS); (ii) the disease existed before but a new etiological agent was discovered (e.g., hepatitis C); or, (iii) the disease existed before and the causative agent was identified, but it appeared for the first time in a geographic area where no case had been diagnosed previously (e.g., West Nile Virus epidemic in the USA) (74) . An EID is obviously unusual; it is surrounded by uncertainty and anxiety.

In summary, we investigated the structure resonance energy transfer from microwave to CAVs of H3N2 virus in water-based solution. The efficiency of such energy transfer was investigated through exploring the virus inactivation ratio. Based on the proposed damped mass-spring model and the experimentally measured microwave absorption cross-section of a single virus, threshold magnitude of electric field to fracture viruses at different illuminated frequencies can be estimated. After the illumination by the microwave, the plaque assay experiment indicated that the inactivation ratio reaches its maximum at the resonant frequency of the dipolar resonance. The real-time RT-PCR experiment double confirmed that the main inactivation mechanism was through physically fracturing viruses without degrading viral RNA genome. This work not only theoretically and experimentally demonstrates a new energy transfer mechanism between EM waves and viruses, but also indicates an efficient SRET effect. Our results have important implications for the interaction between microwaves and biological tissues, which is a highly concerned public issue. With an observed inactivation threshold with a microwave power density within the IEEE safety standard, the demonstrated SRET mechanism also provides a pathway toward establishing a new epidemic prevention strategy in open public for airborne viruses. Microwave Absorption Spectrum Measurement. The microwave absorption spectrum measurement was performed by combining the coplanar waveguide (CPW) circuit with a microfluidic channel. As shown in Fig. 3(a) , we covered the structure of the CPW by the microfluidic channel with a 1.25 mm-long sensing zone (L). The gap between the signal electrode and the ground electrode of the CPW was 25 μ m. In order to decrease microwave loss on the electrodes, the gold layer thickness of the electrode was 1.2 μ m. On the surface of electrodes, we grew a thermal isolator layer of silicon dioxide on the sensing zone by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) to lower the temperature rise of fluids due to microwave dielectric heating 30 . We then used a network analyzer (Anritsu, MS2028C) as the source to measure the absorption spectrum of H3N2 viruses from 6 GHz to 14 GHz. The virus particle density in the solution was 7.5 × 10 14 m −3 . The spectrum of the solution without viruses was first measured as a reference; solution with viruses was later measured. By removing the solution background, the microwave absorption spectrum of H3N2 viruses in solution was thus obtained (Fig. 3(b) ) following a procedure similar to ref. 8. Microwave Illumination Measurement. In our experiments, we used two different microwave sources, depending on the utilized microwave power: a network analyzer (Anritsu, MS2028C) or an Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) oscillator. Then the microwave signal was amplified by a power amplifier (QPJ-06183640) and radiated from the horn antenna (ELECTRO-METRICS, EM-6969). The aperture size of the antenna was 9.8 cm × 7.1 cm. To avoid damage on oscillator and amplifier caused by back reflection, we added an isolator and a directional coupler. All the microwave systems were put in a P2 class flow hood. The antenna was directed toward the bottom (Fig. 4(a) ) or the side (Fig. 5(a) ) of flow hood and the microwave was normally incident on either microscope slides ( Fig. 4(a) ) or acrylic cuvettes (Fig. 5(a) ) at a distance of 5 cm below the exit of horn antenna. To avoid large reflection from the metal hood surface, the microscope slide or cuvette was put in a plastic dish supported by a broad band pyramidal absorber. For each measurement, the viral solution (7.5 × 10 14 m −3 particle density) under illumination was drop on the slide and covered with a cover glass or was contained inside the cuvettes. Under such an experimental geometry, we illuminated viruses for 15 minutes at various microwave frequencies or at various Scientific RepoRts | 5:18030 | DOI: 10.1038/srep18030 microwave powers. After illumination, we used buffer to wash-down and collect the viruses, which introduced a 10-fold dilution of virus concentration. Then the illuminated viral solutions, together with the control sets were sent for plaque assay.

The newly emerged coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which was first identified in China in December 2019. It is a highly contagious infection that can spread from person to person through close contact and respiratory droplets. The healthcare personnel of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery are especially vulnerable to the infection due to their extensive and close exposure to patients' oral and nasal cavities and secretions. As one of the busiest specialised hospitals in the world, the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology summarised the experience with disease prevention and control and clinical recommendations on the examination, diagnosis and treatment processes, clinical management, healthcare personnel protection and disinfection amid the continued spread of the pandemic.

Few avian viruses represent a risk to veterinary staff and others handling birds, but avian influenza viruses (AIVs) can threaten human health [8, 9, [11] [12] [13] . Wild birds, particularly waterfowl, waders and sea birds, are the natural reservoirs of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and play important roles in the circulation of AIVs [35-38], with potential for transmission of AIVs both to and from poultry and the potential for mutation to generate highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses [6, 7, 39] . Some AIVs can be transmitted from poultry to humans, and some have caused severe disease or even death in humans [8, 9, 11-13, 40, 41] . Transmission of AIVs from wild birds to commercial poultry has occurred recently in Australia in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland [10, [42] [43] [44] [45] . The Australian National Avian Influenza Wild Bird Surveillance Program has been in place since 2006 but primarily targets Anseriformes (ducks, swans, geese) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns and shorebirds) [46, 47] . The prevalence of AIV infection in birds presenting to veterinary care facilities, such as the AWHC, has not been as comprehensively studied [15] . In Australia, avian coronaviruses (AvCoVs) are also of particular interest in wild birds because of the presence of variant forms of the poultry pathogen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Australian commercial poultry [48] [49] [50] . It is suspected that the variant IBV strains contain genetic material derived from AvCoVs hosted by wild birds, but this requires further investigation [48] .

BACKGROUND: On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. METHODS: In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. FINDINGS: The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log(10) copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. INTERPRETATION: We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

Imaging investigations are vital for the management of COVID-19. Owing to the fast imaging speed and high-intensity resolution, chest CT, especially high-resolution CT, has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected COVID-19 cases or patients who have negative results on nucleic acid tests. Based on the lung imaging findings, COVID-19 can be divided into four stages. While there is overlap between the imaging manifestations of each stage, the findings in the critical stage are relatively specific. [7] [8] [9] In the early stage, diffuse subpleural GGOs or small nodular opacities can be found in both lungs, with interlobular septal thickening and fine grid-like shadows observed locally, with the lesions mostly located subpleurally in the lung periphery. In the progressive stage, the lesions undergo rapid progression and changes involving multiple lung lobes and spread from the periphery to the center of both lungs. Some GGOs will fuse into patches with a significant increase in intrapulmonary consolidation. In addition, the "crazy-paving" sign and air bronchograms can be observed, along with significant interlobular septal thickening that may be accompanied by fibrous cord-like shadows, often without pleural effusion. In the critical phase, lesions may increase by more than 50% within 48 hours, and both lungs may show extensive or diffuse consolidation, even presenting with "white-out lung" in severe cases. Air bronchograms can still be observed locally and may be accompanied by a small amount of unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion; lymphadenopathy, meanwhile, is seldom observed. In the recovery stage, bilateral lesions are gradually absorbed and start shrinking, meanwhile, dispersed fibrous cord-like shadows can be observed, showing interstitial fibrotic changes. The imaging manifestations of the present case were consistent with those of previous reports. With respect to the above stages, the case reported here tended toward an imaging diagnosis of the progressive stage.

A 70-year-old woman presented with a history of intermittent fever for 2 days. She had traveled from the epidemic area of Hubei to Dali. Her highest recorded temperature was 38.0°C; in addition she had a wet cough characterized by a small amount of sputum that was white in color and easy to expectorate. There was no cold sensitivity, chills, muscle aches, chest tightness, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, chest pain, or other discomfort. Her medical history was unremarkable. On physical examination, her temperature was 38.0°C, her blood pressure was 146/67 mmHg, and coarse breath sounds were auscultated in both lungs; no other abnormalities were found. Chest CT revealed multiple ground glass opacities (GGOs) in both lungs, predominantly distributed subpleurally and in the middle and lateral lung fields, especially in the right lung, where they had partially fused into patches. Local interlobular septal thickening was also observed. Consequently, the possibility of viral pneumonia was considered ( Fig. 1A-C) . Laboratory tests demonstrated a reduced total white blood cell count (2.43 × 10 9 /L; normal reference values: 4-10 × 10 9 /L) and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (18 mg/L; normal reference values: 0-3.00 mg/L). Throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, thus confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19.

There is a dire need for better quality data 21 . This is a disease with a very long incubation period (up to 24 days 25 ), with median value varying from 4.5 to 5.8 days 26 , which makes it even harder to pinpoint exactly when the infection was actually transmitted from one person to the other. Furthermore, around 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so in between 8.2 to 15.6 days 26 . The number of reported new cases for today reflects a mixture of infections that were transmitted at any point in time over the last few weeks. The time testing takes also influences this. One possible alternative is to model excess deaths when compared to averages over previous years 27, 28 . This is an interesting approach, since it can highlight the effects of the pandemic (see, e.g., the insighful visualisations at Our World in Data 29 , and the Finantial Times 30 ). Again, this is highly dependent on the quality of the data collection process not only for COVID-19 related deaths, but also those arising from different sources. Many different teams of data scientists and statisticians worldwide are developing different approaches to work with COVID-19 data 3, 9, 16, 31 . It is the duty of each country's government to collect and provide accurate data. This way, it can be used with the objective of improving healthcare systems and general social wellbeing.

To this end, we note that F is convex on the non-void, convex cone M = {q ∈ L1(µ) | q ≥ 0} so, for someρ ≥ 0 , we may consider the Lagrangian .

For a large number of health care providers world-wide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is their first experience in population-based care. In past decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, a return of the WHO's singular global authority, and support highly coordinated population-based management. As Osler recognized, his concept of "one medicine, one health" defines what global public health is today.

In 2002, a new infectious disease was found in the southern part of China which had high mortality and morbidity and was termed ''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' (SARS). It affected 8096 people and led 774 patients to death around the world, within a very short span of time [1] . Several studies have shown that SARS is caused by a new member of the coronavirus family. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was supposed to be transmitted from wild animals [2] [3] [4] . This hypothesis was then supported by the identification of a SARS-CoV-like virus in civet cats, sold in markets in south China. This isolate had more than 99% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, indicating that the virus was recently transferred from animals to human beings [5] . However, according to a recent report there is no direct evidence that the civet cat virus is the origin of the SARS-CoV [6] . Although unlikely, the possibility that SARS-CoV positive animals were infected from humans cannot be formally excluded, and it was indeed reported that SARS-CoV was transmitted from man to pig [7] . The mechanism how the pathogen broke the barrier between its natural reservoir and man is still unclear [8] .

The material properties of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its proteins are discussed. We review the viral structure, size, rigidity, lipophilicity, isoelectric point, buoyant density and centrifugation conditions, stability against pH, temperature, UV light, gamma radiation and susceptibility to various chemical agents, including solvents and detergents. Possible inactivation, downstream and formulation conditions are given, including suitable buffers and some first ideas for quality-control methods. This information supports vaccine development and discussion with competent authorities during vaccine approval and is certainly related to drug-targeting strategies and hygienics. Several instructive tables are given, including the pI and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins in comparison. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in many regards, so information can often be derived. Both are unusually stable, but sensitive at their lipophilic membranes. However, since seemingly small differences can have strong effects, e.g., on immunologically relevant epitope settings, unevaluated knowledge transfer from SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 cannot be advised. Published knowledge regarding downstream processes, formulations and quality assuring methods is, as yet, limited. However, standard approaches employed for other viruses and vaccines seem to be feasible, including virus inactivation, centrifugation conditions and the use of adjuvants.

In the few last years, CoVs of the dog have undergone a genetic evolution mainly through accumulation of point mutations and deletions in some genomic regions rather than through recombination events. Changes in the group-specific genes located between ORFs 2 and 4 have been postulated to be responsible for increased virulence of CCoV type II strains (Sanchez-Morgado et al., 2004; Decaro et al., 2007d) . Point mutations in the S gene have been also suggested to be involved in the emergence of pantropic CCoV (Decaro et al., 2007d) . CRCoV emerged likely as host variant of a BCoV strain that was able to spread from cattle to dogs . A different origin could be hypothesised for CCoV type I. Based on the close genetic relatedness to FCoV type I in the S gene, a potential recombinant origin of this CCoV genotype had been suggested (Pratelli et al., 2003a) . However, the recent identification of ORF3 in the genome of CCoV type I should lead to reconsider its origin. In fact, since remnants of ORF3 were found in some type II CCoVs, the most likely scenario is that CCoV has lost this gene during its evolution, probably because ORF3 is not indispensable for viral replication (Lorusso et al., 2007) . Consequently, an ancestral carnivore CoV could be thought to have generated both CCoV genotypes and FCoV type I as well.

East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) died in June 2012 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and was reported on September 20 (1) . The second case reported globally was in a Qatari national patient who had been transferred from Qatar to a hospital in England; preliminary data sharing on September 23 indicated that isolates from the second case-patient had 99.5% identity with the virus identified in the first case. (2) . On September 24, 2012, Public Health England (PHE) (formerly the Health Protection Agency [HPA]) established an enhanced surveillance system to rapidly detect and investigate possible cases of MERS-CoV infection among travelers to England from the Middle East. The first 12 months of surveillance in England identified 1 additional case of MERS-CoV in a traveler returning from the Middle East and 2 cases among family contacts of this second case.

Cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 2 days after transfection. The cells were then rinsed three times in PBS and fixed for 15 min in freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde (Sigma) at room temperature. After washing three more times with PBS, the cells were mounted on slides with 75% glycerol-PBS. Images were obtained with 40× NA 1.0 oil immersion objective lens of a confocal microscopy (FV1000, Olympus). CFP and YFP fluorophore were excited by 458-and 514-nm laser lines at 25-mW argon laser. Band pass filters of 462-484 and 580-612 nm were used in collecting emission from CFP and YFP, respectively. For acceptor photobleaching, images were obtained in the CFP and YFP channels; then a region of cell was selected and the intensity of the signal was calculated. YFP was then selectively photobleached in the defined region of the cell. A second set of images was then obtained using the same conditions prior to photobleaching. The increase in CFP fluorescence after YFP photobleaching corresponds to the original amount of energy transferred from CFP to YFP; thus, the difference in CFP fluorescence before and after photobleaching corresponds to the level of FRET. Effective FRET ratio (E EFF ) between CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) was quantified with acceptor photobleaching methods (Karpova et al., 2003) using the following equation:

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has spread to more than 23 countries since the first case of a MERS coronavirus (MERS CoV) infection was confirmed in Sep 2012 [1] . Because MERS CoV has led to mortality as high as 40%, it has become one of the most important emerging pathogens threatening human health. Recently, the outbreak of MERS CoV, which resulted in 172 infections and 27 deaths in South Korea, was the largest outside Saudi Arabia. A 44-year-old man, had been exposed to the first confirmed MERS case who shared a ward with the man's father in this outbreak, travelled from South Korea to China, becoming the first imported MERS case reported in China. Here, we report the sequencing and analysis of the MERS CoV genome from this case. Viral genome sequencing provides information vital to tracing the pathogenic source, predicting viral virulence, and following the pattern of viral evolution, variation, and transmission [2] [3] [4] .

Coronavirus can cause respiratory syndrome which to date has affected about twelve thousand individuals, especially in China. Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (MCs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. Viral activate MCs release early inflammatory chemical copounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provoke the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-33. Here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus maybe inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family members.

Many viruses, including coronaviruses, have been shown to propagate from the nasal epithelium past the cribriform plate to infect the OB; this form of central infection has been suggested to mediate olfactory deficits, even in the absence of lasting OE damage (18, (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) . The rodent coronavirus MHV passes from the nose to the bulb, even though rodent OSNs do not express CEACAM1, the main MHV receptor (50, 54) ( Figures S3C, S4E, S5A) , suggesting that CoVs in the nasal mucosa can reach the brain through mechanisms independent of axonal transport by sensory nerves; interestingly, OB dopaminergic juxtaglomerular cells express CEACAM1 ( Figure 4E ), which likely supports the ability of MHV to target the bulb and change odor perception. One speculative possibility is that local seeding of the OE with CoV-2-infected cells can result in OSN-independent transfer of virions from the nose to the bulb, perhaps via the vascular supply shared between the OB and the OSN axons that comprise CN I. Although CN I was not directly queried in our datasets, it is reasonable to infer that vascular pericytes in CN I also express ACE2, which suggests a possible route of entry for CoV-2 from the nose into the brain. Given the absence of ACE2 in OB neurons, we speculate that any central olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 is the secondary consequence of pericyte-mediated vascular inflammation (43) .

Metapneumovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are emerging pathogens in transplantation patients. The clinical spectrum of disease from metapneumovirus ranges from symptomatic (even fatal) to asymptomatic cases. Some groups have suggested a possible correlation with graft rejection in lung transplant recipients. Diagnosis is often made using molecular assays; the full impact of this infection in transplantation is yet to be realized. SARS, caused by a zoonotic coronaviruses, is a highly contagious and rapidly progressive form of viral pneumonia, which spread from Asia to many parts of the world in early 2003. A number of transplantation patients were infected, some of whom died. The impact of SARS and resulting infection control issues was significant for both active organ transplantation (i.e., concerns about transmitting donor-derived infections) as well as routine follow-up care for transplantation patients, some of who deferred healthcare visits.

Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses with characteristic spike glycoproteins that project outward like the rays of the sun (corona – Latin for ‘crown’), when visualized by electron microscopy. CoV are classified, together with the toroviruses, in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido – Latin for ‘nest’) of 3′ co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002–03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), first reported in 2012, is likely transmitted from camels to humans with potentially fatal consequences. To date, there are no approved vaccines or direct acting antiviral drugs to combat coronavirus infections in humans. The emergence or re-emergence of CoVs from animal reservoirs is a potential concern for public health.

In the middle of 19 th century, Ignac Semmelweis, known as the Saviour of Mothers, [10] recognized the 59 personal chain of pathogen transfer and mandated hand-washing to disrupt this process. Quarantines have 60 an even more remote history, dating back to 14 th century [11] . In an effort to protect the coastal cities from 61 diseases arriving on incoming boats, passengers were placed in isolation for a period of time and 62 monitored for the presence of disease before being allowed to interact with the local community. All of 63 the measures implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic, which have been in practice in the 64 medical and surgical community for centuries, are intended to break the chain of pathogen transfer. There is no doubt that this pandemic shall also pass and we will return to our "normal" lives. Many, however, 66 believe that the new normalcy will have different features than what was present prior to COVID-19. Our 67 profession will also witness changes in everyday routines that will be necessary to overcome the issues 68 with the current pandemic and diminish the scale and gravity of future epidemic/pandemics. As we 69 prepare to emerge from this pandemic and contemplate resuming our practices, we are faced with the 70 ever-pertinent question of what changes will we need to implement in our daily routines. This article is 71 written, with reliance on available evidence from the past and the current events, to provide some 72 guidance on strategies that may need to be implemented to disrupt the chain of pathogen transfer. These Once such normalcy resumes, we have to entertain the major question of what changes we will need to 80 introduce in our practices to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from infected hosts to others. We will 81 also need to be cognizant of the potential for re-infection with the virus and the emergence of a second 82 wave.

Previous studies have indicated the synergistic mechanism between IBV and AIV-H9N2, possibly by trypsin-like proteases encoded by coronaviruses that enhance the AIV-H9N2 hemagglutinin cleavage (Haghighat-Jahromi et al., 2008; Hassan et al., 2017) , which increases replication and pathogenicity of AIV-H9N2. In this study, we did not find any synergistic effects on pathogenicity when different types of IBV co-infected SPF chickens. Replication and infection of IBV are primarily initiated in the respiratory tract regardless of the tissue tropism of the strains. From the respiratory tract, the virus spreads through the host via viremia (Jones and Jordan, 1972) to the ciliated epithelium of the oviduct, causing necrosis and malformation (Chousalkar and Roberts, 2007; Crinion et al., 1971; Jones and Jordan, 1971) , and to the renal tubular epithelial cells, causing renal failure with urate obstruction due to tubular necrosis with mononuclear inflammation Itakura, 1996, 1997; Condron and Marshall, 1986; Jones, 1974; Purcell et al., 1976) . The severity of the disease in various organs depends on the IBV subtype and ultimately determines the mortality in chickens. Single and combined infections with our three isolates did not cause obvious clinical signs and we did not evaluate the histopathological lesions. However, we found that viruses persisted in the respiratory tract longer in some chickens incombined infected group than those in individually infected group. Further study is needed to confirm the results on pathogenicity of different IBV types using more virulent strains, especially with different tropism, to evaluate whether damage in different organs caused by strains with different tropism has synergistic effects on pathogenicity when the birds are co-infected. The results from the experimental infection in our study might not hold true under field conditions because it is not true that same amounts of different genotypes co-infected a bird in the field conditions.

The lockdown response to the upsurge of COVID-19 cases in the UK in March 2020 brought an immediate end to my current research project's on-farm, in-depth social scientific fieldwork in the North of England. This research, funded by the Welcome Trust, 1 is itself focused on persistent, endemic infectious diseases-but in our case in cattle populations. As a team of social scientists, historians, and economic and epidemiological modellers, we explore the history of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) in the UK, examine how farmers, vets and other professionals attempt to deal with BVD in the present, and attempt to model infection patterns and how farmer behaviours affect the transmission and prevention of this disease. BVD can be transmitted between animals or passed from a cow to her calf in utero. Its effects vary in severity but it is linked to reduced productivity, various symptoms of ill-health, and increased susceptibility to other illnesses.

There are four possible routes of MERS-CoV transmission in humans and camels, namely camel-to-human, human-tohuman, camel-to-camel, and human-tocamel ( Figure 1 ). The former three routes have been well accepted [3, 4] . In the Sabir et al. study [1] , the high prevalence again suggests that MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels and could be transmitted among camels. However, the humanto-camel transmission is theoretically possible but largely ignored [5] , because of the obsession of animals as sources of human viruses. Recent studies reveal influenza A virus can be transmitted from human to a range of animal species (especially swine), a phenomenon known as reverse zoonosis [6] . For another CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), reverse zoonosis has been reported in cats and pigs [7] . When inspecting Sabir et al.'s phylogenetic trees of MERS-CoV (Figures 1, S2 , and S3 in [1] ), we found many viruses of camel origin fell within the diversity of human viruses. There are two possible explanations for this phylogenetic pattern: (i) It is artifact due to sampling bias, if many camel viral strains are not sampled. If this is the case, we must miss substantial diversity of MERS-CoV and should expand our surveillance in camels to fully capture the MERS-CoV diversity. (ii) MERS-CoV could be transmitted from humans to camels, which means that humans serve as a source of MERS-CoV for camels. The role of camels in generating and maintaining MERS-CoV diversity has been repeatedly emphasized [1] . If human-to-camel transmission occurs, it requires us to refine our concept of the definition of a 'breeding ground' for MERS-CoV, which has important practical implications for developing vaccination strategies and control measures.

Small or low-density populations can only sustain a certain type of infectious agent, one that persists, usually for the life of the host. 6, 7 Once infected with herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus, we are infected for life, and such viruses have infected us since even before we became human beings. [8] [9] [10] [11] To some extent, this was the primordial state of disease in diffuse bands of preagricultural hunter-gathers: persistent viruses, bacteria (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), intestinal protozoa, worms, and fleas. Our Paleolithic ancestors were not disease-free, but they almost certainly did not experience periodic and devastating epidemics. 12, 13 Conversely, large populations that live at high density, such as modern human beings, can sustain a much greater diversity of infectious agents, including those that the immune system is able to clear. Transmission from person to person is rapid enough and continuous, such that there is little selective pressure for persistence. Large and dense urban populations can maintain acutely infectious agents indefinitely due to a constant source of newly susceptible hosts in the form of immigration or births. These agents often share an ability to be transmitted by casual contact such as respiratory droplets produced by a cough or a sneeze, and as evidence of the success of this pathogen strategy, there are more than 200 different viruses from at least 6 different virus families (adenovirus, coronaviruses, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus) that cause "cold" symptoms: sneezing, coughing, and runny nose. 14 The dawn of agriculture and the domestication of animals, especially herd animals, allowed the emergence of permanent human settlements and the growth of large situated communities. 15 The world's population increased approximately 1000-fold from the beginning of the agricultural revolution to the end of the 19th century, and most importantly, settlements eventually grew into a huge massing of humanity. Simultaneously, we domesticated animals and ourselves, and we sampled all of the viruses and bacteria existing in cows, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, and birds. Those that could replicate in human beings and spread from person to person by respiratory propulsion (or other means, such as fecal-oral) became established evermore in the human population. This is the answer to why we are the most diseased species on earth. We are the only species to so profoundly and rapidly change the way in which we interact with each other and other animals; in other words, we invented for ourselves an entirely new ecosystem. So, in addition to the endless parade of cold viruses that circulate among us, we acquired a great many deadly infectious agents, such as those that cause diphtheria, influenza, measles, meningitis, mumps, plague, rubella, smallpox, typhus, whooping cough, and others. Each disease has its own history and severity, but all rely on large, high-density populations for continued propagation.

Extracorporeal lung assist combined with low frequency positive pressure ventilation has been recommended, when conventional therapy fails. Today, extracorporeal gas exchange may be carried out using a system internally coated with covalently bound heparin. This allows for a lower level of systemic heparinzation reducing the risk of severe hemorrhagic complications of extracorporeal respiratory support. From April 1989 to August 1993 89 patients, aged from 15 months to 60 years, were transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of severe ARDS. All fulfilled at least the slow entry criteria of the U.S. National ECMO Study. Due to hypoxemia 13 patients required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) immediately after transfer to our ICU. The other 76 patients were first treated with pressure controlled mechanical ventilation, permissive hypercapnea, prone position, and dehydration, if necessary. In 23 out of these 76 patients, in which the gas exchange did not improve in the following days, veno-venous ECMO with heparin-coated systems was additionally performed. Heparin was given to achieve a partial thrombin time between 40 -55 s and an activated clotting time between 120 -150 s. If surgery was performed during ECMO, heparin infusion was interrupted. No severe bleeding complications related to anticoagulation for the extracorporeal bypass could be observed, however, in some patients, after three weeks of ECMO thrombi in the drainage cannula were observed. A problem of of membrane leakage shortened the life span of the membrane lungs to a mean of about four 4 days. In the conventionally treated group 87% survived and in the additionally with ECMO treated group 58% survived, representing a 75% survival rate in patients whose risk of death is considered more than 50%. On the basis of these experiences, we conclude that the described strategy, including veno-venous ECMO with heparin-coeted systems, may improve the survival in patients suffering from severe ARDS.

[ 5 ] further define reservoirs within multi-host communities as encompassing ' one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population ' .	Zoonotic diseases, or diseases that originate from non-human animal hosts, represent over 60% of the emerging infectious diseases that negatively impact human populations [1, 2] . Of these, more than half infect multiple animal hosts [2] [3] [4] . For these multi-host pathogens, it is essential to differentiate between reservoir host species that enable persistence of the pathogens within a community as opposed to incidental hosts that do not play roles in disease maintenance [5] . Haydon et al. [5] further define reservoirs within multi-host communities as encompassing 'one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population'. The recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) exemplify how challenging it can be to identify the species that constitute these multi-host communities and their relative roles in transmitting disease within host communities and into human populations [5] [6] [7] [8] . To best mitigate human risk, an understanding of these potentially complex host communities is needed across broad temporal and spatial scales.

The migratory behavior of some bats provides an opportunity for pathogens to spread over long distances, as reported for flying foxes of the species Eidolon helvum able to migrate more than 1000 km 36 38 . In Ghana, Pfefferle et al. 6 identified a strain of Alphacoronavirus in H. cf. ruber closely related to the human coronavirus 229E. Our finding argues that close relatives of the human coronavirus 229E exist in African bats 14 . The phylogenetic proximity of the CoV strains identified in this study with the human CoV-229E strain suggests a risk of emergence of this virus in humans in Africa. Furthermore, the 10GB0354 alphacoronavirus strain (MG963188), from H. gigas bats caught in 2010 in the Faucon cave, was phylogenetically close (93.8% nucleotide identity) to the Alpaca CoV strain detected in the Vicugna pacos species, commonly known as alpaca (JQ410000). Maganga et al. 17 and Corman et al. 14 already described two Gabonese CoV strains from hipposiderid bats caught in 2009 in the Faucon cave closely related to Alpaca CoV. Indeed, this coronavirus was described in 2007 during the epidemic of severe respiratory disorders associated with abortions in alpacas.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans account for 75 percent of new and emerging infectious diseases. Globally, high-consequence pathogens that impact livestock and have the potential for human transmission create research paradoxes and operational challenges for the high-containment laboratories that conduct work with them. These specialized facilities are required for conducting all phases of research on high-consequence pathogens (basic, applied, and translational) with an emphasis on both the generation of fundamental knowledge and product development. To achieve this research mission, a highly-trained workforce is required and flexible operational methods are needed. In addition, working with certain pathogens requires compliance with regulations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent regulations, which adds to the operational burden. The vast experience from the existing studies at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, other U.S. laboratories, and those in Europe and Australia with biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities designed for large animals, clearly demonstrates the valuable contribution this capability brings to the efforts to detect, prepare, prevent and respond to livestock and potential zoonotic threats. To raise awareness of these challenges, which include biosafety and biosecurity issues, we held a workshop at the 2018 American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Biothreats conference to further discuss the topic with invited experts and audience participants. The workshop covered the subjects of research funding and metrics, economic sustainment of drug and vaccine development pipelines, workforce turnover, and the challenges of maintaining operational readiness of high containment laboratories.

Oh and his coworkers have developed a fluorescent biosensor based on a site-specific enzymatic cleavage reaction to detect a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) by utilizing the GNPs as energy acceptors (quencher) ( Figure 3A ) [49] . A small peptide sequence with a fluorophore (fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC) on one end was conjugated to the GNP through the functional amine group on the other end. Initially, fluorescence associated with the fluorophore was quenched due to the FRET between the fluorophores and the GNPs; however, when the PSA recognized and cleaved the specific sequence of the peptides conjugated to the GNP, a recovery of fluorescence signal was observed due to the splitting of the FITCs from the GNP. In a similar way, Degliangeli et al. functionalized GNPs with fluorophore-labeled DNA-probe strands to detect miRNA ( Figure 3B ) [50] . The presence of target miRNA led to the hybridization of DNA-RNA strands, and, following enzyme hydrolysis, fluorescence signal recovery was observed by splitting fluorophores from GNPs. As an alternative direction for developing fluorescent based biosensors, Bracamonte and his group have developed highly fluorescent nanoparticles by utilizing GNPs as the core, silica as the shell (as a spacer), and rhodamine b (RhB) as a fluorophore for bacteria imaging and sensing ( Figure 3C ) [51] . The plasmon resonance maximum of the core-shell nanoparticles was able to be red shifted due to interactions with the GNP core based on the thickness of the silica shell. The PEF effect from the GNP core was also evaluated by applying sodium cyanide as a gold leeching material. In addition, bright and clear bacteria images were obtained by laser fluorescence microscopy after labeling them with the developed core/shell PEF nanoparticles. Teixeira et al. also utilized GNPs as cores and covered them with an polyelectrolyte shell to promote enhancements for a phthalocyanine fluorescent dye [52] . Similar to these approaches, various studies were performed to verify the effect of spatial variation by controlling spacing within shell thickness. For example, Montaño-Priede et al. demonstrated that the maximum fluorescence enhancement of quantum dots (QDs, CdSe) was observed when a silica shell between a GNP core and QDs was approximately 10 nm; however, both the reduction and the increase of shell thickness diminished the enhancement effect of the fluorescence either by energy transfer from the QDs to GNP or a larger separation between the CdSe QDs and GNP core, respectively ( Figure 3D ) [53] .

Abstract Background Since the first case of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, a series of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 were found in Beijing. We analyzed the data of 262 confirmed cases to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Beijing. Methods We collected patients who were transferred by Beijing Emergency Medical Service to the designated hospitals. The information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory test for the COVID-19 virus, diagnostic classification, cluster case and outcome were obtained. Furthermore we compared the characteristics between severe and common confirmed cases which including mild cases, no-pneumonia cases and asymptomatic cases, and we also compared the features between COVID-19 and 2003 SARS. Findings By Feb 10, 2020, 262 patients were transferred from the hospitals across Beijing to the designated hospitals for special treatment of the COVID-19 infected by Beijing emergency medical service. Among of 262 patients, 46 (17.6%) were severe cases, 216 (82.4%) were common cases, which including 192 (73.3%) mild cases, 11(4.2%) non-pneumonia cases and 13 (5.0%) asymptomatic cases respectively. The median age of patients was 47.5 years old and 48.5% were male. 192 (73.3%) patients were residents of Beijing, 50 (26.0%) of which had been to Wuhan, 116 (60.4%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 21 (10.9%) had no contact history. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (82.1%), cough (45.8%), fatigue (26.3%), dyspnea (6.9%) and headache (6.5%). The median incubation period was 6.7 days, the interval time from between illness onset and seeing a doctor was 4.5 days. As of Feb 10, 17.2% patients have discharged and 81.7% patients remain in hospital in our study, the fatality of COVID-19 infection in Beijing was 0.9%. Interpretation On the basis of this study, we provided the ratio of the COVID-19 infection on the severe cases to the mild, asymptomatic and non-pneumonia cases in Beijing. Population was generally susceptible, and with a relatively low fatality rate. The measures to prevent transmission was very successful at early stage, the next steps on the COVID-19 infection should be focused on early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities in Beijing.

Jie Wei Zhang, Deborah Zamble, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. Contact e-mail: kzhang@chem.utoronto.ca E.coli expresses at least three [NiFe] hydrogenase enzymes, which catalyze the production or consumption of hydrogen gas and occupy a central place in the energy metabolism of anaerobic bacteria1. The assembly of the hydrogenase metallocenters requires SlyD and the proteins encoded by the hyp genes (hypABCDEF) [1, 2]. SlyD is a member of the FK-506 binding protein family of Peptidyl-prolyl Isomerase (PPIase) [3] . In addition to its PPIase domain, SlyD is composed of a molecular chaperone domain and a C-terminal tail rich in potential metal binding residues. SlyD directly interacts with HypB and the disruption of the SlyD-HypB complex results in deficient hydrogenase production in vivo [2, 4] . To examine the role of SlyD in hydrogenase biosynthesis, mutations that disrupt the PPIase activity were prepared. SlyD(I42S, F132Y) and SlyD(I42S), which displayed 1% and 40% of wild-type levels of PPIase activity respectively, could restore 61% ±10 and 41% ±9 of total hydrogenase activity in vivo. Both mutants interacted with HypB in vitro and accumulated the same level of cellular nickel under anaerobic growth condition. These results suggest that the PPIase activity of SlyD does not contribute to cellular nickel accumulation or hydrogenase activity. Additional in vivo experiments suggest that the SlyD-HypB complex may play a role in nickel storage in E.coli. Laccase (EC 1.10.3.1) is a four copper oxidase that catalyze the oxidation by molecular oxygen of phenols up to phenoxyl radicals, which can evolve up to quinones. These are reduced by ascorbic acid (vitamin C) which oxidizes to dehydroascorbic acid. The spectrophotometric assays of laccase oxidizing ABTS in presence of ascorbic acid, they show a lag period proportional to the concentration of this vitamin. The assay conditions, reaction medium, concentration of enzyme and of chromogenic substrate have been optimized. A broad linear range with submicromolar limits of detection and of quantitation of ascorbic acid has been reached. The sensitivity of the method was higher for Trametes versicolor than for Agaricus bisporus laccase. The test is sensitive, precise and quick and requires low quantities of sample. The method has been applied to assays of quality control in drugs that contain vitamin C as active ingredient. Furthermore, the method is useful to evaluate the antioxidant activity of ascorbic acid. The assay does not require electrochemical neither spectrofluorimetric instruments. The method is applicable on spectrophotometers (1mL cuvette) and on multiwell microplate readers, which favours its mechanization for high throughput screen assays. Rubredoxin (Rd) is a small protein (~5 kDa), containing a simple redox centre (one iron atom coordinated to four cysteinyl residues), present in all species of the Desulfovibrio genus. Rd has been assigned to play an important role in the oxygen detoxification pathway, donating electrons to enzymes such as superoxide reductase and rubredoxin:oxygen oxido-reductase. In the oxidized form, the inherent high-spin of the Fe(III) ion can be used to probe the interaction site of other metalloproteins, in particular using NMR methods, due to the induced pseudocontact shift and linewidth broadening. In this study, we used Desulfovibrio gigas Rd (both Fe and Zn-substituted forms) and cytochrome c 3 , a tetraheme containing protein, isolated from the same organism, as a model of a transient electron transfer complex. In order to determine these effects we have used 1 H NMR titrations. We have observed that increasing amounts of rubredoxin induce selective heme methyl shifts and linewidth broadenings (only with the Fe form), and an apparent Kd of ~10 M was determined. These results are in agreement with the higher ranked complexes obtained using a softdocking algorithm program, BiGGER 1 , that predicted a cluster of solutions with Rd binding near the heme IV of cytochrome c 3 . Thanks to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, sulfur dioxide and sulfites have been used as food additives for many years. However, sulfites have been occasionally implicated as asthma triggers [1]. As a consequence, the EC Directive 95/2/EC includes sulfites in the list of preservatives and antioxidants endorsed in specified products with a Maximum Permitted Level [2] . The classical methods for sulfite determination in food products are time consuming and have a low sensitivity. Therefore, is very important to develop a new analytical tool capable of easily quantifying sulfites in complex samples. With the aim of constructing an electrochemical sulfite biosensor based on a selective enzyme, we have been studying and characterizing the dissimilatory sulfite reductase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 -Desulfoviridin (Dsv) The enzyme is composed by three subunits of ca. 50, 40 and 11 kDa, all of them showing a strong homology to Dsv from Desulfovibrio vulgaris at the Nterminal. The iron content, as determined by ICP-AES was slightly lower than expected (17±4). From the biosensor point-of-view, the low specific activity of Dsv (nmolmg -1 min -1 range) and the instability of sulfites in solution constitute important drawbacks that should be overcome. In this regard, we also examined by cyclic voltammetry the ability of a set of electronic mediators alternative to methyl viologen (phenosafranine, meldola blue/NADH, neutral red, benzyl viologen and bromophenol blue) to efficiently shuttle electrons to Dsv. Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a family of structurally related nonheme iron containing dioxygenases. They catalyse the insertion of molecular oxygen into polyunsaturated fatty acids that contain one or more 1,4 pentadiene moieties to give the corresponding hydroperoxides. LOX products can be further metabolized to yield signaling molecules such as aldehydes and jasmonate. The insertion of oxygen exhibits high regio-and stereo-specificity. This specificity is dependent on the primary sequence of the enzyme, which is predicted to determine the orientation and depth of substrate penetration into the active site. Although there is an abundance of information on plant and animal LOXs, the number of prokaryotic LOXs that have been described is limited. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae are known as sources of biologically active compounds among which are alcohols, alkanes, aldehydes and branched hydrocarbons, which may derive from primary LOX products. Analysis of the genomic sequence of the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 revealed two genes with homology to the LOX of the prokaryotic organism Pseudomonas aerigunosa. The two enzymes, NpLOX1 and NpLOX2, were isolated and tested for catalytic activity against linoleic and -linolenic acid. Both proteins were identified as linoleate 13-LOXs by expression in E. coli. Interestingly, at the position of the postulated determinants of regiospecificity within the active site, the two enzymes contain different amino acids in comparison to known 13-LOXs. NpLOX1 was further characterized: It showed a broad pH optimum ranging from pH 4.5 to pH 8.5 with a maximum at pH 8.0 and -linolenic acid was the preferred substrate. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a gram-negative -proteobacterium isolated from the freshwater Lake Oneida, USA. Genomic analysis of this metal-reducing bacterium has identified 39 genes encoding c-type cytochromes[1] (determined using the c-type heme attachment motif, CXXCH), a large proportion of which contain multiple heme groups. This profusion of cytochromes confers upon the organism a wide respiratory flexibility and the ability to utilise a diverse range of electron acceptors, including Fe(III) and Mn(IV), nitrite, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfate and fumarate. A putative octaheme cytochrome, containing eight CXXCH motifs, with no homologs of known function has been identified and overexpressed. This protein has been purified and identified as a tetrathionate reductase, and the structure has been solved to 2.2 Å. [2] , [3] Despite the presence of eight conventional hemeattachment motifs, the protein structure revealed the presence of seven normally ligated c-type heme groups and one unusual lysineligated CXXCK heme at the active site. This unconventional lysine heme ligation has been previously observed only in the pentaheme nitrite reductases, however in these cases lysine ligation was predicted by a CXXCK motif. Assays to determine potential substrates for this enzyme have shown activity with a range of nitrogen-containing compounds, including nitrite, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and hydroxylamine. Additionally, a mutant of the ligating lysine has been prepared and work is currently underway to determine its structure and kinetics. Laccases are four-copper containing enzymes exhibiting dual reactivity. Their ability to oxidize a large panel of substrates including recalcitrant environmental pollutants and to reduce molecular dioxygen into water makes them promising enzymes for the development of biosensors and biofuel cells, respectively. However, these applications require the challenging preparation of stable enzymes-coated electrodes with well-defined catalytic properties toward both substrates and dioxygen. We report the immobilization of a recombinant Trametes C30 LAC3[1] using the nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)/histidine-tag technology that requires mild protein modification. Analysis of the his-tagged LAC3 in solution indicates that addition of the polyhistidine moiety does not strongly affect its catalytic activity. Moreover, it allows formation of a stable enzyme monolayer on gold electrodes. The catalytic cycle of immobilized LAC3 was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and analysed using available theory for ping-pong mechanisms and immobilized enzymes. [2] To achieve a complete analysis of LAC3, the kinetic characteristics of the immobilized enzyme were compared with their homogeneous counterparts. Our results indicate that high surface coverage of fully functional LAC3 can be obtained by using this immobilization procedure. COX11 is a copper-binding protein, which plays a crucial role in the incorporation of copper into the Cu B site of cytochrome c oxidase. In this study, we carried out the expression and characterization of human COX11 (hCOX11). The gene of hCOX11 codes 276 amino acids, parts of which are predicted to be present as trans-membrane helices. We cloned C-terminal soluble domain, Cys121-Asn276, in pPICZ B vector. The expression plasmid was used to transform into the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) X-33. The hCOX11 was expressed as a soluble form in P. pastoris under control of the inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promoter. The purified hCOX11 was observed at ~ 18 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This result is consistent with the molecular weight calculated from the translated cDNA sequence. The far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of hCOX11 showed characteristic features of a folded protein with beta-strands and alpha-helical structures. Analytical gel filtration showed that hCOX11 was eluted as dimmer with no effect induced by the reducing agent DTT. This behavior suggests that the dimerization would not involve formation of disulfide bonds. The mechanisms responsible of the dimerization and the interaction with copper are under study. The results will be present and discussed. Lactoperoxidase (LPO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) belong to the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily. Both enzymes are critical elements of the innate, i.e. nonantigenic immune system. Lactoperoxidase is a monomeric protein consisting of a single polypeptide that binds a modified heme via two ester linkages. By contrast, MPO is a dimeric protein with a single disulfide bridge between symmetry-related halves, each of which contains two polypeptides. In MPO the heme is also covalently attached to the protein via two ester bonds, but it is the only heme protein with an additional sulfonium ion linkage. The mode of heme binding strongly affects the biophysical and biochemical properties of these metalloproteins. In order to elucidate the effect of heme to protein linkages on the thermal and conformational stability of LPO and MPO in their ferric forms, we have performed comparative electronic absorbance, electronic circular dichroism and intrinsic steady-state fluorescence studies on protein unfolding by urea and guanidine hydrochloride as well as with increasing temperature both in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol. Determination of thermodynamic (free enthalpies, enthalpies and entropies) as well as kinetic parameters of denaturation revealed differences between LPO and MPO, which will be discussed with respect to the known structures of human MPO and bovine LPO. However, an accessory protein (MMOB) is required to regulate the reaction of substrates with Q. MMOB forms a specific complex with MMOH that controls access to Q on the basis of substrate size. This allows MMO to preferentially oxidize methane in the presence of other potential substrates with weaker C-H bonds. The binding of MMOB perturbs the spectroscopic characteristics of the diiron cluster as well as the extent to which the C-H bond breaking reaction proceeds by quantum tunneling. Thus, the effects of the surface interaction are transmitted to the MMOH active site. Using NMR relaxation and site directed spin-labeling, we have mapped the interface between the MMOH and MMOB components [1]. There are clear solvent exposed and buried MMOB surfaces in the complex, but the relative orientation of the two components could not be determined by these approaches. In current studies, fluorescence donor-acceptor pairs are placed on MMOH and MMOB so that the specific orientation of the two components can be mapped using FRET techniques. Supported by NIHGM40466. Complex I, NADH:quinone oxidoreductase, is the first and the biggest complex of all that constitute respiratory chain. This enzyme couples electron transfer from NADH to quinone to the proton translocation across the membrane, which contributes to the membrane electrochemical potential that is the driving force for ATP synthesis. Complex I is composed of multiple polypeptide subunits and contains several prosthetic groups involved in its activity. The fact that many mitochondrial diseases are related to complex I defects shows the need to know more about the structure and function of this large respiratory chain complex. Rhodothermus marinus complex I, our model system, is a NADH:menaquinone oxidoreductase and has been extensively characterized [1, 2] . The genes coding for R. marinus Nqo subunits are clustering in two operons, nqo1-7 (nqo A ) and nqo10-14 (nqo B ) and two independent genes, nqo8 and nqo9. [3] Our recent results concerning the identification of the subunits are reported. By mass spectrometry, of the complex in solution, was possible identified all the subunits of the complex. Using this same technique, with digest SDS-PAGE bands, were identified just the subunits that constitute the peripheral part of the complex, Nqo1-5 and Nqo9. The subunits Nqo1, Nqo3 and Nqo9 were also identified by immunoblotting with antibodies against subunits of Neurospora crassa Complex I. Photosynthetic (PET) and respiratory electron transport (RET) are physically separated in eukaryotic cells but share common components (e.g. plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f, cytochrome c6, plastocyanin etc.) in cyanobacteria. As in most other phototrophic prokaryotes, the intracytoplasmic membrane contains a dualfunction PET-RET system, whereas the cytoplasmic membrane contains only RET without photosynthetic reaction centres. In RET terminal respiratory oxidases (TROs) function as the final electron acceptor ("electron sink") reducing O2 to water in a concerted fourelectron transfer reaction. Genome and expression analysis suggest that cyanobacteria can contain one or more representatives of TROs from both the heme-copper oxidase superfamily and the non-copper or bd-type oxidase superfamily. A detailed genomic (29 strains, 19 completely sequenced genomes), sequence and structural (subunits I & II) analysis of cyanobacterial heme-copper oxidases and their putative electron donor proteins (cytochrome c6, plastocyanin and cytochrome cM) revealed that heterocyst-forming nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria usually have more than one gene for obligatory cytochrome c oxidase (aa3-type) and cytochrome c6. Many cyanobacterial strains lack genes encoding heme copper quinol oxidases. All cyanobacteria have a single-copy gene for cytochrome cM and plastocyanin (exceptions Gloebacter violaceus & Thermosynechococcus elongatus). These data are discussed with respect to known in vitro interactions between these metalloproteins and to physiological relevance. The S100 proteins are small, dimeric Ca 2+ -binding proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and cell growth, differentiation and mobility in vertebrates. Several studies indicate expression misregulation of these proteins in a number of cancers. The Ca 2+ binding sites are EF-hands. As in other EF-hand proteins, Ca 2+ binding to S100A2 elicits the displacement of an helix exposing a hydrophobic patch which is the docking site for proteins involved in downstream signalling. The most studied one is transcription factor p53. Besides binding Ca 2+ , S100A2 also binds Zn 2+ with high affinity. Each S100A2 monomer binds two Zn 2+ ions in sites different from the Ca 2+ ones. The physiological role of Zn 2+ seems to be the modulation of the Ca 2+ affinity, as Zn 2+ binding to one of the sites decreases the binding affinity of the Ca 2+ , a unique mechanism in the S100 family so far. Our current research goal is to characterize the conformational and stability properties of S100A2 discriminating the effect of the binding of each metal to its cognate site. To accomplish this, engineered forms of S100A2 with mutated Zn 2+ cysteine ligands were used. Biophysical and biochemical techniques such as circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies have been employed in assessing conformational changes dependent of temperature, chemical denaturant concentration and metal loading status. Here we report the effects of Zn 2+ binding to the high affinity site and discuss its repercussions in the physiology and conformational tuning of S100A2.

9361304	transmissible	human	human							9	9	11	11	13	13	It is now clear that the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus is transmissible from human to human .	BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China since Dec 2019 and cases of infection have been continuously reported in various countries. It is now clear that the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus is transmissible from human to human. Nucleic acid detection is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this case report, we describe our experience in detection of SARS-COV-2 from a confirmed patient using nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) samples but not nasopharyngeal swabs. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of severely ill SARS-COV-2 infected 46-year-old man with fever, coughing and chest tightness. We performed viral detection using his BALF samples and imaging method (CT) for confirmation. The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages. Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes. We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration. The patient was cured and discharged. CONCLUSION: This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.

Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1,700 bedside clinicians have been infected. A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9. For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.

A new study published by the journal "Aging & Disease" by a team led by Dr. Zhao reports that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into seven patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes and facilitated recovery [1] . COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] [3] . This new coronavirus has elicited a pandemic of respiratory ailment since December 2019. It first appeared in Wuhan, China, but has now disseminated to multiple countries in the world, including the United States [2] [3] . Even with painstaking global restraint and confinement efforts, the prevalence of COVID-19 continues to climb, with an increasing number of new cases and significant mortality worldwide [3] . Coronaviruses are commonly found in people and multiple species of animals. Sometimes, animal coronaviruses infect people and spread from person to person [4] . SARS-CoV-2, one such example, causes mild to severe symptoms, which include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but severe cases (~2%) have been observed to result in death [1] [2] [3] .

We show that U-counts reach the highest values and Ccounts the lowest values at the third position of the HCoV-NL63 codons ( Figure 5 ). Analysis of the synonymous codon usage indicates that codons with a high U and A content are preferred over C and G rich codons (Table 1) . Thus, the peculiar genome composition has a direct effect on the codon usage of HCoV-NL63, and possibly even an indirect effect on the amino acid composition of coronaviral proteins by affecting the nonsynonymous codon usage [24] [25] [26] . The synonymous codon usage of HCoV-NL63 clearly differs from that in human cells. Thus, the genome may have been shaped by cytosine deamination over an evolutionary timescale, but it is possible that the translational machinery has restricted this genome drift because of the availability of tRNA molecules. Inspection of the viral genome sequence led us to predict that the 1ab polyprotein is expressed from the genomic RNA and the 3' structural proteins and ORF3 from 5 distinct sg mRNAs. This was confirmed experimentally. We observed that sg mRNAs are more abundant when the corresponding TRS is located closer to the 3' end of the genome. The exception is formed by the E sg mRNA, which is relatively underexpressed. This may correlate with the low expression level of this protein. The general trend of increased gene expression along the genome has been reported previously for other coronaviruses [19] . A possible mechanistic explanation is that the viral polymerase density is reduced along the genome or that the polymerase becomes less susceptible to execute a transfer from body TRS to L TRS during extended (-) strand synthesis. Fine-tuning of the efficiency of the strand-transfer processes may be modulated by many other features, including the local sequence and structure of the core body TRS and its flanking regions. It was reported previously [27] that the core of the L TRS of group 1 coronaviruses is presented in the single stranded loop of a mini-hairpin. We found similar motifs in HCoV-NL63 (results not shown). Although not excessively stable, this structural motifs is predicted to fold as part of the complete leader sequence, and it may participate in the strand transfer process.

Taking the positive view that Ap 4 A is a bona fide regulator, what conclusions can be drawn about its principal intracellular role(s)? Rapid suppression of interferon responses after activation of the initial signal transduction pathways is an essential part of the overall immune response to pathogens to avoid the potential toxicity of the many anti-viral, pro-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative proteins that are induced. Therefore, the NuKO phenotype may reflect the activation of these feedback mechanisms. Alternatively, components from infecting pathogens such as proteins or 5 0 -ppp RNAs may actively cause the increased intracellular Ap 4 A by inhibiting NUDT2 in order to down-regulate the immune responses. Poliovirus infection is known to cause a slight (2-fold) increase in Ap 4 A [162] while the SARS coronavirus protein 7a physically interacts with NUDT2, although the effect of this on the level of Ap 4 A is not known [163] . Recently, it has been shown that the viral-induced mediator of the interferon response, cyclic GAMP, can be transferred from cell to cell inside newly-formed virions, and it has been speculated that this is a protective, host-regulated mechanism to rapidly establish an antiviral state in newly infected cells [164, 165] . It is equally interesting to speculate that viruses may also package Ap 4 A into new virions to counteract this. With regard to bacterial pathogens, the two types of bacterial Ap 4 A hydrolase, the asymmetrically-cleaving NUDT2 homologue RppH (also known as YgdP or IalA) and the unrelated symmetrically-cleaving ApaH, have been classified as invasion proteins and are required for optimal survival of bacteria during cellular invasion [166] [167] [168] [169] . They may help to prevent high host cell Ap 4 A induced by infection-associated stress from inhibiting essential bacterial functions.

Current counts show nearly 500,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including more than 20,000 deaths around the globe. There are more than 65,000 confirmed cases in the USA to this date. Updated live counts are available on the WHO, CDC, and Johns Hopkins websites. The largest number of confirmed cases is from China, where the first reported cases were identified in the city of Wuhan in the late November of 2019 (Wang et al. 2020b ). Investigations tracking initial confirmed cases indicated that a cluster of patients had been associated with a local food market in this city. Reports of infection then occurred in South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan. Initial reports from these countries showed recent travel or close contact to patients that had traveled to China. This was followed by local spread from person to person (Guan et al. 2020) . To date, China has more than 80,000 confirmed infections but has largely stemmed the surge using drastic social distancing measures and has experienced more imported than community-spread cases in the last 3 weeks. Italy has experienced some of the highest death rates, in line with having the second oldest population worldwide, and both Italy and the USA are expected to surpass China by total confirmed infections before April. Indeed, cases have now been identified in countries across all continents, and new cases are being reported at increasing rates compared with China.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was first discovered in 2012 and has since caused more than 1700 cases and 700 deaths worldwide. 1,2 MERS is caused by MERS-coronavirus, which can be transmitted from camels to humans and from humans to other humans. 3, 4 The vast majority of cases to date have been reported out of Saudi Arabia, where MERS is endemic due to frequent interactions between humans and dromedary camels. 2, 5 That said, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 75% of cases in Saudi Arabia are due to human-to-human transmission, although the vast majority of cases cause no secondary infections. [6] [7] [8] [9] Worldwide MERS-coronavirus transmission appears to be amplified in nosocomial (healthcare) settings, resulting in greater numbers of infections than would be otherwise expected given only direct (i.e., human-to-human) household or communitywide transmission. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] This was exemplified during the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea, which was initiated by a local businessman returning home from a visit to the Middle East and resulted in nearly 200 nosocomial cases soon thereafter ( Figure 1 ). 12 Throughout the entirety of the outbreak, the South Korean government provided a wealth of publicly available information on case demographics, including case contact details crucial for reconstructing networks of infectivity. However, it remains unclear whether or not certain types of cases were more likely to cause direct (i.e., human-to-human) secondary transmissions than others, and if so, why.

Once the first case was identified, the infection was possibly spread from animal to human as a zoonotic agent. A second human-to-human route of transfer confirmed a surge in cases in Wuhan and globally after the shutdown of the Wuhan market and relocation of cases in China. At the time of writing this review, Although China declared that it is free of new cases, but have been reported at the beginning of April of 2020 of viral re-emergence. A surge in the reported cases in Europe (Italy, France, Spain and UK) and the USA had been reported [15] . This review is intended to provide an informed opinion on the epidemic and forms in which this initial outbreak may be handled and avoided with expert insight into the current and potential available therapies. Scientists at the Scripps Research Institute have found no proof that SARS-CoV-2 is a product of bio-engineering (manipulation) in laboratory facilities by conducting a comparative analysis of genomic data [16] . Therefore, this virus is possibly novel and subsequent natural results of the mutations that the CoVs family is renowned for having.

Non-COVID-19 patients were transferred from medical to surgical ICU in the first week in order to increase ICU surge capacity for COVID-19 patients. In the beginning of the second week, all medical ICU beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. The cardiac surgery ICU (4 beds) was transformed to a COVID-19 ICU, as scheduled surgical and medical activity was stopped. Sixteen additional beds were added in five operative and post-operative rooms. Eight beds "non-COVID-19" ICU was created in another postoperative room. Surgical ICU was also converted into COVID-19 ICU.

CVLPs, identified by electron microscopy in the faeces of neonates with necrotising enterocolitis in France (61), have been shown to replicate in H R T 18 cells, a cell-line derived from a human rectal adenoeareinoma (34, 35, 36, 61) , although titres of infectious virus were not reported. These CVLPs have been considered by the authors to represent an HECV. No CPE was produced by the presumptive HECV in these cells, but, immunofluoreseenee could be demonstrated using labelled antiserum against bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV). BECV has also been grown in HRT18 cells in this laboratory (35) and it has been suggested by some workers that the human isolates may be BECV derived from a laboratory contamination as virus cross-contamination of tissue cultures ca.n sometimes occur.

In the simplest case of non-random mixing, individuals may be similar with respect to their infectiousness and susceptibility to infection, but the population may be divided into distinct communities, with infrequent contacts between communities. This could be considered to approximate the situation for childhood infections, such as measles, among different towns or villages. If infection is introduced to each community simultaneously, the resulting epidemic will follow the expected pattern of spread for an unstructured population 20 . If communities are distributed across a landscape and infection is introduced to just one community, however, travelling waves of infection can occur 20, 47 , as shown for the spread of measles before the introduction of vaccination in the United Kingdom 48 . waves of infection during the epidemic season spread out from large cities to smaller towns. non-random mixing has important implications for the impact of vaccination. If individuals who are missed by a vaccination programme tend to be from the same community, coverage must be greater than the critical threshold p c (Equation 6), as transmission can be sustained within the unvaccinated community 49 . In The netherlands, for example, overall vaccine coverage against measles is high, but low coverage in specific communities owing to parental refusal to vaccinate children has led to localized disease outbreaks, with a reproduction number that is greater than one 50 .

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a disease first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and it can be transmitted from human to human. This disease has spread to several other countries, most confirmed cases have displayed symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness and many of these patients have died. This research is aimed to construct a mathematical model for the transmission of MERS-CoV in two areas by separating the human population into two groups; susceptible and infectious groups. The dynamics of the disease is studied by a compartmental model involving ordinary differrential equations. The basic reproductive number of this disease is discussed to control the outbreak of this disease. Sensitivity analysis of this model is performed to determine the relative importance of the model parameters to the MERS-CoV transmission.

It has also been identified as the most significant source for human infections [1] . The isolates of MERS-CoV from camels and humans have also been found to more than 99% identical [2] . While camels have been identified as the primary source of MERS-CoV infection through both indirect as well as direct contact, the specific route and role of camels in disease transmission is yet to be identified.

One of the salient questions regarding the biology of HIV is: how did it emerge as a human virus? I will argue that the ability of HIV to cause persistent infections likely played a key role in its emergence, and is therefore worth a brief consideration in this essay on viral perpetuation. Although circumstantial, the evidence is quite persuasive that HIV arose when a simian lentivirus, SIVcpz, jumped from chimpanzees to humans [9, 11, 13] . Many animal viruses cause zoonotic infections of humans but very few of them are subsequently transmitted from person to person. Most of those zoonotic viruses that are capable of limited human-to-human transmission exhibit marginal transmissibility, as evidenced by their containment using rudimentary quarantine measures and their fade out after a limited number of cycles. Examples are Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [20] ; arenaviruses [14] ; Ebola virus [22] ; swine influenza virus in 1976 [17, 24] ; and monkeypox virus [8] . The SARS coronavirus may be another example although to date it has not established itself as a human [9, 11, 13, 18] virus, even though it underwent at least 30 human-to-human passages in China in 2003 before being controlled by quarantine measures [27] . Rare indeed are those zoonotic viruses that become established permanently as human viruses. The best documented examples are influenza viruses, since avian influenza virus has on several occasions established itself in humans. It is noteworthy that, in several of these instances (such as the Asian pandemic of 1957 and the Hong Kong pandemic of 1968) the avian virus re-assorted with a human influenza virus, to produce a genetic chimera that endowed it with novel antigenic determinants, while maintaining the capability to transmit to humans [29] .

All RNA viruses that have been shown to replicate in yeast belong to the group of (+)RNA viruses. This large virus group includes many important plant, animal and human pathogens such as HCV and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). All (+)RNA viruses share common features in their replication cycles. First, the genomic RNA serves as messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation of the viral proteins and as template for replication. Since these two functions are mutually exclusive, the transfer of the genomic RNA from the cellular translation machinery to the replication complex must be highly regulated. Second, viral replication complexes are associated with intracellular host membranes which proliferate and rearrange in response to the expression of viral protein. And third, host factors are required at multiple steps of the viral replication cycle [56] [57] [58] .

Regarded as the worst of the major epidemic diseases, smallpox visited New York regularly. In 1649, smallpox spread from Massachusetts to New Amsterdam, prompting Governor Peter Stuyvesant to call for a day of prayer and fasting. Thirty years later, an epidemic spread throughout the city with significant effects. Jasper Dankaerts' diary for June 1681 noted that military exercises were suspended throughout the year because of the epidemic. 30 A major epidemic, described as ''fatal to adults'' and the ''hand of God,'' erupted in the spring and summer of 1689. Although a slave ship infected with smallpox arrived from the West Indies, there was no evidence of any linkage to this ship. 30 In June 1731, a 2-month-long smallpox epidemic broke out, quickly spreading throughout the city. 30 By the end of August, shopping markets closed as smallpox ''raged very violently in Town.'' 31 On November 15, deaths from smallpox numbered 478 whites and 71 Negroes, or about 5-8% of the city's population. 32 During this epidemic, smallpox inoculation, or variolation, was first used on a small scale. Using variolation, a physician inserted a dose of pox-infected pus into a patient's arm. Variolation side effects ranged from a mild case of smallpox in inoculated individuals to occasional death. Statistically, one to five persons per 100 inoculated died from variolation. By 1772, the cost of treatment for smallpox at an inoculation hospital was $4.00 for the doctor's fee and $8.00 for board. 30 In 1731, opponents of variolation believed that ''once inoculation was let loose, smallpox was sure to spread.'' In the next year, 160 persons were inoculated in Jamaica, Long Island, resulting in one fatality. Smallpox returned to New York in 1738, possibly through variolation. Boston newspapers reported that ''smallpox was becoming general in New York.'' Approximately 1,600 cases of smallpox were reported, and Mayor Paul Richard ''admitted its presence'' in the city. 30 ''Smallpox became a constant visitor in New York City'' with outbreaks occurring almost every year for 10 years beginning in 1756. Troop movements during the French and Indian Wars possibly disseminated the disease throughout the American colonies. To stop the spread of the disease, New York and many of the other colonies passed laws prohibiting variolation. In the New York Times of August 21, 1757, Alexander Colden wrote that ''smallpox was epidemic among the children in New York City … the Bells are ringing every day & five or Six children buried of an Evening.'' 30 Dr. Samuel Akerly, one of the first to conduct an epidemiologic study on smallpox in New York, recorded smallpox deaths from 1804 to 1808. His statistics show a decline from 169 deaths in 1804 to 58 deaths in 1808. 30 In January 1809, government officials declared that ''smallpox was spreading in the city.'' They announced the availability of free vaccinations for the poor every Tuesday and Friday. In the following seven months, only 419 people were vaccinated in New York City. In his annual report for 1810, Dr. Gerardus Cooper, the physician of the ''Kine-Pock Department,'' reported that only 169 individuals were vaccinated. He criticized the poor for neglecting their children. Dr. Cooper's pleas for vaccination were ignored and the ''public remained apathetic'' because of no imminent threat preceding this outbreak. 30 Smallpox appeared again in New York in 1815, with 94 deaths reported for the year. On January 29, 1816, the City Council appropriated $1,000 to cover costs to vaccinate the poor. Despite these efforts, 179 persons succumbed to smallpox in 1816 and in 1824, the number of deaths rose to almost 400. 30 A retrospective study concluded that smallpox deaths remained fairly steady in the early part of the nineteenth century relative to deaths from all causes: 1805-1814, 1.9 per 100; 1815-1824, 2.2 per 100; 1825-1834, 1.9 per 100; and 1835-1844, 2.2 per 100. 30 New York City recorded 293 deaths from smallpox in 1870, and 1,098 cases for the year ending April 1, 1871. However, many physicians concealed smallpox patients from sanitary inspectors. 33 Adjusted to include estimated cases that escaped inspectors, the mortality rate for 1870 was 215 deaths per 1,000 individuals afflicted with smallpox. 34 During the nineteenth century, deaths from smallpox comprised a significant percentage of all deaths in New York City. 35 With the disease still present in many areas of the world, a smallpox outbreak occurred in the mid-twentieth century in New York City.

The coronavirus disease 2019 is a highly pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has neuroinvasive capacities, as it can spread from the respiratory tract to the nervous system. Certain viruses invade the Central Nervous System and release inflammatory cytokines, which can play a part in the development of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).

The official toll from the multifocal epidemic that ensued was 8,422 cases and 816 deaths on five continents.1 This startling epidemic demonstrated the continuing risk of zoonotic diseases for humans and the awesome potential for emerging diseases to wreak havoc around the globe. SARS brought several ethical issues associated with new, severe epidemic diseases into sharp focus.

Transmission-based precautions are as described in each institution's infection control policies. Contact precautions require the use of gowns and gloves when there is any contact with the patient or the surrounding area. Droplet precautions are invoked when infectious respiratory droplets can travel directly from the patient's respiratory tract to the recipient, generally over short distances. This necessitates facial protection, such as surgical mask, eye protection, and/ or face shield. Personal eyeglasses and contact lenses are not considered adequate eye protection. 110 Historically, the area of defined risk has been a distance of 3 ft or more around the patient, although depending on the size of the droplets (smallpox and SARS are examples of small droplets), the infective area may be up to 6 ft from the patient. Droplets do not remain infectious over long periods of time and therefore do not require special air handling and ventilation. Airborne infection isolation precautions prevent transmission of infectious agents that remain infectious over long distances when suspended in the air (e.g., rubeola virus [measles], varicella virus [chicken pox], Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and possibly SARS coronavirus). If at all possible, EP procedures should be deferred in these patients unless a negative airflow procedure room is available. If an EP procedure is unavoidable, a regular positive pressure procedure room with airflow similar to an OR and a portable highefficiency particulate air filtration unit may be used. 110, 111 The patient should wear a surgical mask, and the staff should wear N95 filter masks. The procedure should be the last case of the day, and the room left empty until adequate air exchange has taken place to clear the room.

Numerous family clustering cases of COVID-19 have been reported in China. Of 1,836 cases that occurred in Guangdong and Sichuan Provinces, 1,308 were related to 344 clusters, most (78%-85%) of which occurred in families. According to a preliminary study ongoing in Guangdong, China, the secondary attack rate within a household is estimated to be 3%-10%. 6) Children primarily contract the disease through household exposure, and 56%-90% of infected children had an infected family member. 10, 11, 14, 28) Children are usually diagnosed with COVID-19 after an exposure to an infected adult within or outside of the family circle; however, the source of infection could not be identified in some cases, while the diagnosis of a child preceded that of an adult in others. A 3-month-old child with confirmed COVID-19 on January 26, 2020, in Hubei Province was hospitalized with fever and found to have mild pneumonia on the chest CT scan. At the time of diagnosis, his parents were asymptomatic with negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results. After 7 days of hospitalization of the infant, his father complained of fever and fatigue, while his mother was asymptomatic; both of his parents showed signs of pneumonia on the chest CT scan and had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results. It was undetermined whether the incubation period was shorter in the infant than in the parents or the virus was transmitted from the infant to the parents. 9, 35) In the first severe case of a 13-month-old who developed pneumonia, shock, acute respiratory distress, and renal failure, the source of infection could not be identified. His parents were not tested for SARS-CoV-2. 32) Influenza surveillance during the first 2 weeks of January 2020 in Wuhan City, in which the COVID-19 outbreak originated, indicated that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in adults but not in children. 6) In an analysis of 365 COVID-19 cases confirmed till February 5, 2020, in Shenzhen, China, the pediatric infection rate rapidly increased from 2% (before January 24) to 13% (between January 25 and February 5) (P<0.001). The possible reasons for this might be that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was lower in children in the early course of the outbreak. Otherwise, children were less likely to be tested because of their mild presenting symptoms and signs, especially in the setting of limited resources in the early phase of the outbreak. 36) Little is known about the duration of viral shedding in children, and the reported durations varied widely across patients and samples. A 6-month-old infant diagnosed in Singapore on February 4, 2020 was asymptomatic but tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample; his mother previously had confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. The blood PCR sample turned positive for SARS-CoV-2 on hospital day 2, when the patient had a fever of 38.5°C that resolved immediately. A series of daily nasopharyngeal samples for PCR revealed that viral load presented as a 1/cycle threshold that peaked at the time of diagnosis and decreased over time. Negative conversion was achieved on hospital day 17. Stool PCR on hospital day 2 was negative but turned positive on day 9. 18) In a study that enrolled 10 Chinese children in Shanghai, Hainan, Hefei, and Qingdao, symptoms appeared at a median 6.5 days (range, 2-10 days) from the onset of illness in the index case. Patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR on a nasopharyngeal or throat swab 4-48 hours after symptom onset, while negative conversion was seen at a median 12 days (range, 6-22 days). Prolonged shedding of viral RNA in the feces was observed for 18-30 days in 5 patients. 28) In summary, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in children primarily occurs through contact with adult patients, mainly through household exposure. In contrast, direct transmission from a child to an adult has not been reported to date. However, the observation of prolonged detection of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal/throat swabs and feces of pediatric patients suggests that children and adolescents may be transmitters in the community.

M iddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged as a significant illness on the Saudi Arabian peninsula in mid-2012, and the causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), MERS-CoV (1) . MERS has a high mortality rate (ϳ35%) associated with severe lung disease that can advance to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MERS-CoV, similarly to SARS-CoV, which caused a similar epidemic in 2003, has been a global cause for concern due to its high fatality rate. Epidemiologic studies established that MERS-CoV is zoonotic in origin, with transmission occurring from dromedary camels on the Arabian peninsula (2) (3) (4) . Spread from camels to people is documented (5) , as well as person-to-person spread among health care workers in hospital settings (6) . To date, MERS-CoV has spread to 27 countries and caused 858 deaths in 2,494 confirmed cases (4 February 2020, World Health Organization [WHO]), including a large travel-related outbreak in South Korea in 2015 (7) . MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus whose entry into target cells is mediated by the viral envelope S protein. The S protein consists of an S1 subunit responsible for binding to the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26), via a receptor-binding domain (RBD), and an S2 subunit that mediates membrane fusion (8) (9) (10) . Thus, the S protein, particularly the RBD, is an important target for MERS-CoV vaccine development (8, 11, 12) . There is currently no vaccine or antiviral therapeutic against MERS-CoV. A number of candidate MERS-CoV vaccines, including those based on recombinant virus, viral vectors (e.g., MVA, adenovirus, and measles virus), nanoparticles, DNA, and DNA/protein, as well as subunit vaccines, are under development (12, 13) . None are approved; thus, the need remains for an effective and broadspectrum vaccine against MERS-CoV infection (14) .

Rationale. Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (G5 not dialyzed [G5ND]) who do not have a PD catheter placed in advance of starting dialysis will require a central venous catheter (CVC) and will need to be treated with incenter hemodialysis (HD). Patients who start dialysis in this way (crash starts) have increased risk of morbidity and mortality. 1 During the COVID-19 pandemic, they are also more likely to use additional health care resources and more likely to have high levels of exposure to health care workers. Recommending PD as a modality in which definitive access can be placed at the outset is efficient and will reduce the number of patients requiring in-center HD. Allowing patients to transfer from in-center HD to PD to mitigate their personal COVID-19 risk, or for any other reason, is valuable in itself, and reduces the resources needed for provision of in-center HD. Adequate downstream staff and support, particularly community support after training, is essential.

The spreading of this virus has been declared pandemic as it is an infectious diseases that spreads quickly from person to person. The structure of the virus which has few possible qualities that allows spreading easily. Firstly, the virus is suggested to be a basically ball of proteins called spike proteins on the surface. Those spikes latch onto a protein called ACE 2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme), which is found on the surface of human cells. The original SERS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus also did the same, but the latching onto ACE 2 is higher due to the specific shape of the spikes of SARS-CoV-2 because they are at closer fit to the ACE 2 protein. Once the attachment is made, the spike protein is split into two equal halves by an enzyme called Furin present in human body at large scale. Hence, the virus gets spread in human body. Most of the respiratory viruses tend to infect either the upper or lower airways of the respiratory system. If the upper respiratory system is infected by virus then the illness is very mild and if the lower airways is infected, they cause severe illness. SERS-Cov-2 seems to infect both the respiratory system due to the wide spread Furin enzyme. Thus, the virus causes severe contagiousness by attacking upper airways of respiratory system, which helps it to spread easily before moving to the lower one. According to the researcher including some research from Cambridge University, there are 3 types of COVID19 [11, 12] . The variants are type A, B and C. The closest type of COVID 19 discovered in Bat was type A, the original human virus genome was presented in Wuhan. The mutated version of A was seen in American and was also found in the patients of USA. The A and C types are mainly found in Europeans and American country [12] . The B type is the most common type variant which is present in East Asia, and its ancestral genome appears not to have spread outside East Asia without mutation. In India, the type of this virus has not been publicly reported yet now. Being new with no vaccine and no adequate treatment protocol, it is challenging for the healthcare workers to combat.

First, with the exception of Ethiopian airlines, all African airlines have suspended flights to China. Although these measures might delay, but not stop, 5 the importation risk of COVID-19 into Africa, their implementation is still worthwhile. Second, although Beijing, Shanghai, and Fujian do not report the highest number of cases of COVID-19 in China, the volume of travel from these cities to Africa is high, which might increase the risk of exporting cases to Africa.

A n ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 , which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, 1-3 is evolving into an international public health emergency. As of March 11, 2020 , the World health Organization has declared the COVID-19 a global "pandemic," with a total of more than 120,000 cases in 114 countries including 4373 deaths. 4 Although the COVID-19 is slowing down and seems under control in China, the cases outside China have risen 13-fold rapidly, with Italy expanding COVID-19 lockdown to the whole country and reporting more than 10,000 cases and 631 deaths. Although the first case was just detected on January 19, 2020, 5 the United States now has more than 1000 infected people and 29 deaths in less than 2 months. 6 The virus can spread from person to person very quickly through respiratory droplets, but also through community spread and asymptomatic infected patients. 7 To protect and save lives, given the very real pandemic threat of COVID-19, it is important for everyone including nuclear medicine personnel to know how to stop transmission, contain, and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Mathematical models can be used to understand the dynamics of epidemics and help inform control strategies. A numerous number of models are being used to project the current COVID-19 pandemic. Ziff and Ziff analyzed the number of reported cases for Wuhan (China) and showed that the growth of the daily number of confirmed new cases indicates an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals [2]. Wang et al. developed an SEIR model to estimate the epidemic trends in Wuhan, assuming the prevention and control measures were either sufficient or insufficient to control the epidemic [3] . Kucharski et al. combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and international cases to estimate how the transmission had varied over time between January and February in 2020 [4] . Kraemer et al. analyzed the impact of interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in China using transportation data [5] . Chinazzi et al. used a global meta-population disease transmission model to project the impact of travel limitations on the national and international spread of the epidemic. They showed that the travel restriction of Wuhan, China had a more marked effect on the international scale than that on Mainland China [6] . Ferguson et al. found that optimal mitigation policies (combining home isolation of suspected cases, home quarantine of those living in the same household as suspected cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA, Canada) and the Italian Republic are continuing to grow. We fit the parameters of our network model to the confirmed cases in each of these regions. Although Wuhan, Toronto, and Italy differ in some ways, the way that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from one person to another is quite similar. Individuals may acquire infection from other infectious individuals, even if they do not contact each other directly. The Watts-Strogatz model supplies an ideal tool to study the spread of epidemics among individuals even if their locations are not considered. We used the Watts-Strogatz model to generate random networks with the small world properties appropriate for infectious disease transmission in these cities [16, 17] .

By the time of the acceptance of our paper, according to the official data released on 319 the 29th of February, the cumulative number confirmed infected cases in Hubei was 320 ∼67,000, that of recovered was ∼31,300 and the death toll was ∼2,800. These numbers 321 are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of 322 February that are based on Scenario I. In Scenario II, by assuming a 20-fold scaling of 323 the confirmed cases of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number 324 of the recovered cases in the total population, forecasts show a significant decline of 325 outbreak in Hubei by 29th of February. This fact has been lately reported. Based on 326 this scenario the casefatality rate in the total population is of the order of ∼0.15%. At 327 this point we should note that our SIRD modelling approach did not take into account 328 many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the 329 effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact 330 transmission network, the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, 331 the characteristics of the population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already 332 health problems). Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an 333 assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and 334 reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from 335 person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of 336 the fecal-oral route [21] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before 337 the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected 338 unknown numbers of people. The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with 339 subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may 340 be substantial; these cases, which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 341 infections, remain unrecognized, especially during the influenza season [22] . This highly 342 likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases 343 inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context, 344 distorting epidemiologic reality. Another important factor that should be taken into 345 consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and 346 confirm cases. A positive PCR test was required to be considered a confirmed case by 347 China's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment program in the early 348 phase of the outbreak [14] . However, the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel 349 viral pathogen may only be 30-50%, thereby often resulting in false negatives, 350 particularly early in the course of illness.

The disease emerged from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as an unknown viral pneumonia diagnosed in 54 individual and by March 25, 2020, it had infected 81,848 people in China alone. Wuhan became the epicenter of COVID-19 just after emergence of the disease. Government and local bodies worked tirelessly to control the spread of COVID-19. Initially COVID-19 was not identified as a humanto-human transmission disease, but with exponential increase in cases research on COVID-19 established the fact that disease is transmitted from human to human via aerosol. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a novel coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae and very little is known about its characteristics (Tekes and Thiel 2016; Ashour et al. 2020) . As we gain more knowledge about CoV2, its spread is also increasing exponentially. The initial epicenter of the disease shifted from Wuhan to Europe to the USA. Italy appears worst affected having 69,176 reported cases till March 25, 2020, with the maximum number of deaths of 6820 infected people. USA with 51,914 positive cases is emerging as another epicenter. Since there is no vaccine or medication available for the novel coronavirus, social distancing and proper maintenance of self as well as surrounding sanitation is the only treatment. The long and strict lockdown in China shows excellent decline in viral infection and social distancing found very helpful in containment of the virus. The initial lighter attitude of European countries and the USA is one of the major reasons for their emergence as an epicenter of the disease. Highly populated countries like India must learn from the mistakes of these nations and implement strict measures for containment of the virus, as uncontrolled outbreak of the disease could lead to a devastating situation for developing countries like India. Another region of potential threat is Iran where the number of deaths has increased exponentially, with 2077 deaths recorded till March 25, 2020. Underdeveloped countries with lack of basic facilities, public awareness, and poverty like Pakistan and African countries may emerge as another epicenter for COVID-19. Special attention and extended help need to be given to such nations for fighting the pandemic.

Recently, in the fall of 2012, ten years after the SARS episode, a SARS-like disease affected individuals that traveled from the Arabian Peninsula to the United Kingdom. Using molecular sequencing, it was rapidly shown that this new respiratory coronavirus was genetically different than SARS-CoV and it is now recognized that the new epidemic is caused by a new coronavirus from the genus Betacoronavirus (Zaki et al., 2012) , that was first named HCoV-EMC (for Human Coronavirus -Erasmus Medical Center), human betacoronavirus 2c and NcoV or nCoV (for novel Coronavirus), and that is now known under the official name MERS-CoV: Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (Coleman and Frieman, 2013; de Groot et al., 2013) , which is the etiologic agent of a severe lower respiratory tract infection that resembles SARS and which can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and possible renal failure . Like other coronaviruses that infect humans, MERS-CoV most likely originated from bats before infecting an intermediary reservoir (probably the dromedary camel in that case), and thus represents a zoonotic transmission to humans. However, human to human transmission has now been demonstrated in several cases (Assiri et al., 2013b; Haagmans et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014) . As of September 18th, 2014, the Public Health Agency of Canada revealed that the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that the MERS-CoV has spread to at least twenty-one different countries, where 841 laboratory-confirmed cases of individuals (including 402 between April 11 and June 9, 2014 in Saudi Arabia alone) have been identified as infected by the MERS-CoV, with 298 being fatal (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2014). As do the four circulating strains of HCoV (Cabeca et al., 2013; Vabret et al., 2009) illnesses in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, infants, immune-compromised individuals or patients with comorbidities (Peiris et al., 2004; Vabret et al., 2009) .

Together with HCoV-HKU1 identified in 2005 (Woo et al., 2005) and HCoV-NL63 discovered in 2004 (Fouchier et al., 2004; van der Hoek et al., 2004) , six HCoVs have been documented up to date. These 6 HCoVs present diseases with a range of clinical severity from typical common cold in HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 to ARDS in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Why these CoVs show dramatically different pathogenicity in human is an important but unanswered question in the field. One model to explain this difference is based on adaptation and host immunity. According to this model, bats are reservoir of various CoVs. Bat CoVs constantly emerge in human via intermediate hosts such as civets and dromedaries. Exposure of immunologically naïve human populations to these CoVs commonly causes severe diseases plausibly due to aberrant activation of innate immunity and lack of immune memory. When some CoVs become better adapted in human by acquiring the ability to transmit from human to human readily, pandemics could arise. Meanwhile, as they become fully adapted, the CoVs might only cause mild diseases in human. Existing evidence supports the origin of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 from bats and other animals (Woo et al., 2009; Huynh et al., 2012; Corman et al., 2015) . Adaptation and virus-host interaction are also known to be major determinants in CoV pathogenesis (Pepin et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2013) . It will therefore be of great interest to see whether emerging human CoVs might be particularly capable of evading innate antiviral response while activating pathological inflammation. In other words, we need to determine whether the more severe clinical presentations might be accounted for by the specific interaction between host and emerging human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In this review, the host innate antiviral response to CoV infection is particularly focused. In addition, the viral strategies adopted by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to subvert innate immunity are also summarized to provide inspiring insights that may explain the discrepancies in virulence (Figure 1 ).

Among the various respiratory viruses infecting human beings, coronaviruses are important pathogens, which usually infect the upper respiratory tract, where they are mainly associated with common colds. However, in more vulnerable populations, such as newborns, infants, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals, these opportunistic pathogens can also affect the lower respiratory tract, leading to pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, and various types of respiratory distress syndrome. The respiratory involvement of human coronaviruses has been clearly established since the 1960s. Nevertheless, for almost three decades now, data reported in the scientific literature has also demonstrated that, like it was described for other human viruses, coronaviruses have neuroinvasive capacities since they can spread from the respiratory tract to the central nervous system (CNS). Once there, infection of CNS cells (neurotropism) could lead to human health problems, such as encephalitis and long-term neurological diseases. Neuroinvasive coronaviruses could damage the CNS as a result of misdirected host immune responses that could be associated with autoimmunity in susceptible individuals (virus-induced neuroimmunopathology) and/or viral replication, which directly induces damage to CNS cells (virus-induced neuropathology). Given all these properties, it has been suggested that these opportunistic human respiratory pathogens could be associated with the triggering or the exacerbation of neurologic diseases for which the etiology remains poorly understood. Herein, we present host and viral factors that participate in the regulation of the possible pathogenic processes associated with CNS infection by human coronaviruses and we try to decipher the intricate interplay between virus and host target cells in order to characterize their role in the virus life cycle as well as in the capacity of the cell to respond to viral invasion.

In 29 December 2019, China reported first 4 cases of "pneumonia of unknown origin" linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, caused by a novel coronavirus -which is now well-known as COVID-19. 1 The virus spread rapidly to every continent in the world and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Malaysia reported its' first confirmed case on 25 January 2020. This was a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, who had travelled from Singapore to Johor Bahru on 22 January 2020. There were only 22 positive cases during the first wave, of which all were discharged well. Following 11 days of zero reported case, the second wave of outbreak started on February 27, with a surge to 553 positive cases by March 16. These cases were related to the Tabligh gathering cluster, held at Sri Petaling from 27 February to 3 March 2020, which was attended by approximately 16,000 people. 2 To reduce the spread of infection, the Malaysian government decided to implement a nationwide Movement Control Order (MCO) effective from 18 March 2020 to 31 March 2020. After 2 weeks of enforcement of the MCO, new cases continued to increase with occasional plateauing, hence the MCO was extended from 1st April until 28th April 2020. Since the implementation of the MCO, all public hospitals in Malaysia have implemented changes at all level, aimed to conserve the limited resources for the battle against this pandemic.

After the SARS epidemic, we started to focus on CoV biodiversity, genomics and phylogeny and built up an evolutionary map of CoV evolution. Before 2003, there were less than 10 CoVs with complete genomes available, which include two human CoVs, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). By September 2012, the number of CoVs with complete genomes sequenced had tripled. It includes two additional human CoVs, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1). 2,3 Traditionally, CoVs were classified into groups 1, 2 and 3. In 2011, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses has re-classified these three groups of CoVs as three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus; and we have discovered a fourth genus of CoV, Deltacoronavirus, which includes at least nine avian CoVs and a porcine coronavirus HKU15. 4, 5 Within the betaCoVs, they are further subclassified into group A, including HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), sable antelope coronavirus, giraffe coronavirus, equine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, murine hepatitis virus, rat coronavirus and rabbit coronavirus HKU14 (RbCoV HKU14); 6 group B, including the human and civet SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoV) and SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV); 7,8 group C, including Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) we discovered in 2006; 9,10 and group D, including Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9 (Ro-BatCoV HKU9). 10, 11 In addition to Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5, other group C bat betaCoVs should also be present, but their complete genome sequences are not available. 12, 13 Based on the CoVs discovered, we have constructed a model of CoV evolution, with evidence supporting that bat CoVs are the gene source of alphaCoVs and betaCoVs and avian CoVs are the gene source of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs. 5 All these works have laid down an evolutionary map for rapid phylogenetic and bioinformatics analyses of HCoV-EMC. The diversity of CoVs is a result T of the infidelity of RdRp which make CoV genomes especially plastic, a high frequency of homologous RNA recombination due to their unique random template switching during RNA replication, and their large genomes. In addition to biodiversity, a number of natural recombination and possible interspecies jumping events has also been documented in betaCoVs. 6, 11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] For group A betaCoVs, molecular clock analysis has shown that HCoV-OC43 is a relatively recent zoonotic virus of bovine origin that emerged in around 1890 likely from bovine-to-human transmission. 17 We have also recently discovered RbCoV HKU14, closely related to other members of the species Betacoronavirus 1 including HCoV-OC43 and BCoV, with recombination events that may have played a role in interspecies transmission of these HCoV-OC43related viruses between human, cattle, rabbits, swine and horses. 6 Despite having circulated in humans for more than a century, HCoV-OC43 is also found to be continuously evolving, with the recent emergence of a novel genotype due to natural recombination. 15 For group B betaCoVs, SARSr-CoV is believed to be transmitted from civet to humans, although it is the horseshoe bat that was likely the primary host. 7, 8 Civet SARSr-CoV was also likely a recombinant virus arising from different strains of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV from different geographical locations in China. 14, 16 Although no interspecies transmission events have been documented in group D betaCoVs, we have also identified recombination events between different Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes. 11 While these findings supported that betaCoVs have the propensity to recombine and cause interspecies transmission, such events were unknown in group C betaCoVs. As HCoV-EMC is most closely related to Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5, it would be important to study their genetic relatedness, which may provide clues on whether bats are the possible origin as in SARSr-CoV.

OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current new virulent disease rising its transmission and fatality with each passing day in the worldwide population. COVID-19 is emerged as a respiratory infection and a suspicious origin of animals and transmission to human in Wuhan, China on December 2019. Later this, the virus was transmitted from person to person through droplets and contacts. The World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China have taken immediate action to reduce transmission and fatality associated with COVID-19 as minimum as possible. However, action has failed to stop transmission of COVID-19 from China to other countries. Since there was no chain break of the virus, the chances are more to increase the case number and fatality. Hence, the study has been designed to perceive the current effect of COVID-19 on the global population and its fatality. The study also focused on review related to treatment for COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online database of epidemic disease COVID-19 cases number was collected from www.channelnewsasia.com on 7(th) April 2020. This data was used to observe the past and present circumstances in the global population and its fatality. The effect of treatment on COVID-19 was reviewed from the few databases of clinical trials (antiviral and antibacterial drugs). RESULTS: The online data are used to observe a significant increase ratio of COVID-19 cases and its fatality rate in worldwide as well as country wise. The COVID-19 cases are high in the United States (27.5%), whereas the fatality rate is high in Italy (12.47%). The prevalence of COVID-19 is expected to be reaching 4 million by the end of April 2020 and the fatality rate also might be reached high. CONCLUSION: We have come to the conclusion that the effect of COVID-19 on the global population is significantly increased and the fatality rate also elevated (2.48% to 5.52%). The hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination treatment has shown significant improvement in patients with COVID-19 compared to treat with other drugs.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, China from December 2019, and has been spread out to the world [1, 2] . As of April 10, 2020, there are 83,323 confirmed cases in China among which 3346 died, while more than 1,527,482 confirmed cases in the world among which 92,532 died [3] . It is speculated that the natural hosts of SARS-COV-2 are possibly wild animals such as bats and pangolins [4, 5] . However, this is still under discussion. The virus could spread from human to human through aerosol, facal-oral route and eye secretions [6] [7] [8] [9] . Further understanding on its epidemiology, transmission mechanism and spectrum of symptoms is under continuous investigation. This case report describes the symptoms, diagnosis and treatments of one unconventional COVID-19 pneumonia case in our hospital during early period of the outbreak when having very little understanding on the virus and the infection.

BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China since Dec 2019 and cases of infection have been continuously reported in various countries. It is now clear that the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus is transmissible from human to human. Nucleic acid detection is considered as the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this case report, we describe our experience in detection of SARS-COV-2 from a confirmed patient using nucleic acid test of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid (BALF) samples but not nasopharyngeal swabs. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of severely ill SARS-COV-2 infected 46-year-old man with fever, coughing and chest tightness. We performed viral detection using his BALF samples and imaging method (CT) for confirmation. The patient received combination of interferonalfa-1b and ribavirin, lopinavir and ritonavir for antiviral treatment at different stages. Other medication was also given to him in combination for anti-inflammation, intestinal microbial regulation, phlegm elimination, liver protection and pulmonary fibrosis prevention purposes. We provided oxygen supply to him using BIPAP ventilator and high-flow humidification oxygen therapy instrument to facilitate respiration. The patient was cured and discharged. CONCLUSION: This case report described an effective supportive medication scheme to treat SARS-COV-2 infected patient and emphasized the necessity of detection of the viral genome using BALF samples and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS--CoV) is an emerging zoonotic agent that was first isolated in 2012 from a patient hospitalized in Saudi Arabia [1] , and has since infected over 2200 people with a 36% case fatality ratio [2] . After an incubation period of 2-14 days [3] , the virus causes a disease (Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS) characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which commonly leads to pneumonia and respiratory failure [4] . The virus circulates silently in dromedary camels, the only known reservoir species and zoonotic source of spillover to humans [5] . However, not all primary human cases have documented exposure to dromedaries or their products, such as milk and meat. Although human-to-human community-acquired infections have not been documented, there is evidence that asymptomatic infections of MERS-CoV exist and could be a source of community transmission [6] . Zoonotic spillover from dromedary camels to humans has been documented in the Arabian Peninsula [7] . Subsequent secondary cases can occur after unprotected contact with family members and within healthcare facilities once the primary case seeks medical assistance [8] . While the sizes of MERS-CoV outbreaks have decreased thanks to improved infection control in healthcare settings in affected countries, cases continue to be reported regularly, especially in Saudi Arabia, where surveillance is strong [9] . In order to further reduce cases and prevent human outbreaks, a better understanding of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV is needed. A deeper understanding of the epidemiology of primary human cases can inform evidence-based interventions at the level of the community at the animal-human interface.

Patients were selected from the Get with the Guidelines-Stroke registry who were transferred to MGH from Jan 2011 to Oct 2015 with NIHSS>6 and last known well<12h on MGH arrival (n=618). We excluded patients for whom we could not calculate transfer time (the MGH arrival time minus the telestroke consult answered time, n=384). Ideal time was calculated using Google Maps incorporating date/time information for ground transfers and straight line distance at 130mph for helicopter transfers. Ideal time was subtracted from actual time to calculate delay, accounting for distance, mode of transport, weather, and traffic. Analysis of covariance was used to explore 3 possible predictors of delay (night vs. day, weekend vs. weekday, tPA delivery at spoke).

Primarily the two data sets can be mapped into a Bloom filter, which is a compact representation of the set and one can compute the set intersection on respective Bloom filters with approximations. Note that, there can be false positives, but no false negative, when one queries into a Bloom filter. One can reduce the false positives by configuring the Bloom filter parameters such as size, etc. There are privacy enabled Bloom filters that can protect privacy of both the parties (server and client). In [8] , privacy enabled Bloom filter based on the above cryptographic approaches is analysed with respect to computing time, storage and communication overheads. This protocol runs in 3 phases: (i) Base phase: Data independent computations are performed. (ii) Setup phase: Data transfer from server to client takes place with O(M) complexity. (iii) Online phase: Computation and data transfer takes place between the server and the client with O(N) complexity. They have implemented the same on both mobile and laptop. On mobile phone, for a maximum cardinality of set 2 20 with 128-bit security, performance of Diffie-Hellman (in online phase) based Bloom filter is approximately 2.5 to 10 times faster when compared to RSA and ECC based Bloom filters. • Cuckoo Hashing. Cuckoo hashing is a data structure, which uses a set of γ hash functions {h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h γ } wherein all the elements of a set can be mapped into different bins without any collision in a compact way. In case of a collision, the current element is relocated into another location. With this, any query for the set membership can be achieved with a constant computation complexity O(1). There are several schemes [6, 14] that use Cuckoo hashing to design PSI in an efficient manner, both in terms of computation and communication. For example, in [13] , it is shown that OT-phasing based PSI protocol requires a factor of 2-3 less communication than that of DH-ECC based PSI protocol. • Count Min Sketch/Counting Bloom filter. In order to reduce the False Positive Rates (FPR), count min (CM) sketch can be used for PSI in a compact way. According to [2] , "CM sketch is a probabilistic data structure that serves as a frequency table of events in a stream of data. It uses hash functions to map events to frequencies, but unlike a hash space, at the expense of over counting some events due to collisions". This needs to be explored from privacy preserving computation, communication, storage and update perspective. The advantage with this data structure is besides computing PSI, one can also record/count the frequency of the data element that is repeated in the set (multi-set) in a compact way. For example, the number of COVID-19 positives in a particular location spotted where a normal healthy person visited at the same time can be computed along with the matching in a compact way. 34 2 24 We assume inputs are hashed and keys are generated. Prime numbers p and q are of 2 12 bits. Input size α = 2 8 and Security parameter τ = 2 12 Table 3 . Performance Analysis of PSI Schemes with m = 2 20 and n = 2 10 .

Multiple measures have been initiated to meet this ongoing demand for health care professionals and medical facilities. Physicians have returned out of retirement and traveled from their home cities to New York in an effort to relieve the clinical burden on the area. On March 17, JHMC increased its hospital capacity by 150% by opening up unused wards, turning specialty wards into COVID-19 wards (eg, pediatric ward converted to COVID-19 ward), and deploying outdoor open-ward tents, On March 30, the United States Naval Ship Comfort arrived in New York City to add about 1000 additional hospital beds to the City's armament. 21 On April 1, the Army Corps of Engineers completed its conversion of the 840,000 square foot Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into an alternate care facility equipped to care for 2000 patients. 22 On April 3, 52 students at NYU Grossman School of Medicine graduated early to join the medical wards, intensive care units, and emergency departments at NYU Langone Health. 23 Despite these milestone achievements, several physician deaths due to COVID-19 in the area have acted as reminders about the dangers to health care professionals working in these clinical environments.

Many of the patients who survive COVID-19 associated critical illness will require admission to an inpatient rehabilitation facility to optimize functional status before eventual discharge and community reintegration. In the context of a pandemic, special considerations are required with regard to when a patient is "ready" for transfer to such a facility. 8 Ideally, patients being transferred from acute facility to rehabilitation setting should have no ongoing signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection including resolution of fever without antipyretics, documented evidence of two consecutive negative virologic specimens (ie, nasopharyngeal throat swabs) 24 hrs apart, 48 and a clear written plan with regard to code status. 8 Inpatient rehabilitation populations typically comprise a particularly vulnerable patient group. They are likely to be older and may be immunosuppressed, multimorbid, and dependent on others for fulfillment of basic personal activities of daily living, meaning that they require regular daily physical contact with health care providers trained to assist with personal care and safe mobilization. 8 Isolation in such a setting is challenging.

At this point we should note that our SIRD modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact transmission network, the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, the characteristics of the population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already health problems). Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [21] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people. The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases, which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized, especially during the influenza season [22] . This highly likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality.

Beside viruses circulating in livestock, wildlife has the potential to be a large reservoir of unknown zoonotic viruses. Hunting, trading, preparing, and consuming so-called "bushmeat" is one of the routes by which novel viruses can be introduced into the human population (Karesh and Noble, 2009) . It may be difficult to disentangle foodborne infection from direct zoonotic exposure, but it is important to consider local practices before ruling out food as a source of human infection. A special example are the occasional introductions of Nipah viruses from bats into humans through contamination of date palm sap which is collected in open containers to which bats that harbor these viruses have access (Rahman et al., 2012) . Not proven but certainly interesting is the practice of drinking unprocessed camel urine which may contain MERS coronavirus, a practice that came to light during the investigations into sources of MERS coronavirus infection in humans (Funk et al., 2016) . Even if limited in scale, small foodborne infections, originating from human-wildlife interaction, constitute as many incidents potentially pushing wildlife viruses to become human-to-human transmissible (Wolfe et al., 2005; Islam et al., 2016) . In the cases of Monkeypox and Nipah this only led to small epidemics, but when the virus is well adapted to spread from human to human this can lead to larger outbreaks, as seen during the Ebola crisis in 2015 (Wolfe et al., 2005; Mann et al., 2015) . Continuing deforestation, increasing population and continued trade of bushmeat brings more humans in contact with wildlife and increases the risk of zoonosis (Karesh and Noble, 2009 ). Urbanization and globalization of travel and trade provides ample and increasing opportunity for further spread. Therefore, even anecdotal zoonotic introductions may constitute a public health risk, and ideally should be investigated in conjunction with the animals these humans were exposed to. As the ability to spread between humans is a key property for successful further spread, enhancing the capacity to investigate clusters of disease (in humans and animals) is important (McCloskey et al., 2014) .

Our results demonstrate two consistent and dramatic phenotypes associated with MHV-induced macropinocytosis: ruffling with vesicle internalization and filopodia associated with cell fusion and recruitment into syncytia. The fact that inhibition of MHV-induced macropinocytosis impairs the overall virus titer while not affecting entry or intracellular infectious virus suggests the possibility of multiple functions that favor overall virus fitness, specifically, recruitment of membranes and nutrients into infected cells and syncytia, enhancement of virus release, or virus cell-to-cell spreading. MHV A59 acquires its viral envelope by budding through the ERGIC and is released from the cell without lysis via the exocytic pathway. No previous role for a traditionally endocytic pathway such as macropinocytosis has been reported to be used during viral release (36, 37) . The observed increase in the formation of long filopodia from infected cells that contact and recruit uninfected cells into syncytia suggests a role for macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which CoVs potentiate cell communication over significant distances. Filopodia could act as mediators of CoV cell-cell fusion by concentrating spike protein and virus at the filopodium tip. Actin modifications have been previously implicated in the cell-to-cell spreading of other viruses. Vaccinia virus utilizes actin tails to infect distant cells at a rate faster than that at which it infects adjacent cells (38, 39) . HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic virus use filopodia to create virological synapses to transfer infectious material from one cell to another (40, 41) . Macropinocytosis can occur in polarized cells (42) and could represent a novel mechanism of virus cell-to-cell spreading over tight junctions within airway epithelium. Viral spreading in this manner has several advantages over viral spreading via exocytosis, specifically, immune evasion, concentration of reagents, speed, and the capacity to circumvent physical barriers. Increasing the size and duration of plasma membrane extensions could increase opportunities for interactions with adjacent or distant cells.

Several blood-borne infectious diseases-among them viral hepatitis B and C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection-may be transmitted by body contact during sports activities. In professional football, for example, there are-on average-four bleeding injuries per game. However, researchers consider that the estimated risk of HIV transmission seems to be less than one in one million. In the case of hepatitis B transmission during exercise, the theoretical risk is also extremely low-a bit above the risk of HIV transmission. There are seven known hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G), of which hepatitis A and E are usually passed from person to person, whereas hepatitis B, C, and G viruses are transmitted by blood. Wrestlers and boxers are in close body contact, then they are more prone to infections than soccer and basketball players or judo athletes, whose risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission is moderate. These pathogens could be transmitted by the use of common contaminated items or bleeding wounds during sports. Health care professionals should pay careful attention to the risk of horizontal transmission of hepatitis B in contact sports. It is the responsibility of athletes to inform physicians, trainers, and other staff about any health condition as well as possible injuries or lesions before competition. If there is bleeding during competition, the athlete should be removed from play immediately, bleeding should be controlled, the wound should be washed with soap and water, or an antiseptic solution, and the area should be covered with occlusive dressing to resist the impact of sport activity. Once the situation has been brought under control, the player can return to play.

Among the 76 patients, 25 (32.9%) had the same pathogens identified from the OPS and BALF suspension array, and 14 (18.4%) had concordant negative results. For the 14 cases, they might be infected by some rare pathogens that are not covered by our suspension array. The top 5 pathogens were RSV, SP, Hi, MP and Adv, accounting for 74.2% of etiological fraction. Our data are in agreement with other recent findings in multi-country case-control studies that found RSV was the most common cause of severe childhood pneumonia [20, 21] . Thus, RSV could be a primary target for children hospitalized with respiratory illness. In general, RSV is most commonly found in lower respiratory tract infections particularly in infants [22] . However, the sensitivities of RSV between OPS and BALF was not significantly different in our testing. RSV infection and replication initiates in the nasopharynx.

Nine days later, the WHO announced that the virus could be transmitted from person to person. By mid-January, the virus had infected a total of 830 people, among which 495 were citizens of Wuhan and 549 were citizens of other cities and rural areas of Hubei Province and other parts of China. The Chinese government shut down all of Hubei Province, suspending all public transportation and closing passage through airports, train stations, and national highways.

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. FCoV can be divided into serotypes I and II. The virus that causes FIP (FIPV) is believed to occur sporadically and spread infrequently from cat to cat. Recently, an FIP outbreak from an animal shelter was confirmed in Taiwan. FCoV from all the cats in this shelter were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of this outbreak. Thirteen of 46 (28.2%) cats with typical signs of FIP were identified. Among them, seven cats were confirmed by necropsy and/or histopathological examinations. Despite the fact that more than one FCoV was identified in this multi-cat environment, the eight FIP cats were invariably found to be infected with a type II FCoV. Sequence analysis revealed that the type II FIPV detected from fecal samples, body effusions and granulomatous tissue homogenates from the cats that succumbed to FIP all harbored an identical recombination site in their S gene. Two of the cats that succumbed to FIP were found to harbor an identical nonsense mutation in the 3c gene. Fecal shedding of this type II virus in the effusive form of FIP can be detected up to six days before death. Taken together, our data demonstrate that horizontal transmission of FIPV is possible and that FIP cats can pose a potential risk to other cats living in the same environment.

The need and the expectation that control and prevention will involve coordinated action across scientific, organisational, geographical and political boundaries are greater today than at any time before. It is now possible for a person to travel from one side of the globe to the other in less than the time that it takes for most infectious diseases to become symptomatic following exposure to a source of infection. The experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the 2009 influenza pandemic, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and gastrointestinal outbreaks such as that associated with sprouting fenugreek seeds in Germany demonstrates the need for rapid and coordinated international action to control outbreaks and emerging infections. A similar need has become clear after several plant health emergencies, including Xylella fastidiosa, ash dieback and Phytophthora ramorum . International legislation and agreements, such as the EU Decision on Serious Cross-Border Threats to Health (2013) and the International Health Regulations (2005), reflect the need for formalised threat detection and response coordination arrangements at the international level. Coordination could be delivered at the global level, through a global operations room. The purpose of a global operations room, whether it be virtual or a single physical entity, would be to ensure that appropriate decisions are made and appropriate actions taken in response to emerging threats. The function would be to bring together the appropriate information and the appropriate expertise, and to provide the technical and organisational infrastructure to support threat detection and response coordination. There are many questions and challenges that need to be addressed in the setting up of such an operations room, including the establishment of the political mandate and mutual trust required to ensure effective coordination between national and supranational authorities; creating the network of expertise required to enable the operations room to deal with the full range of threats requiring global coordination; developing the technical infrastructure for threat detection and communication, and for coordination of the response; and establishing standard operating procedures for escalation and de-escalation of the threat response, and for command and control arrangements in risk management.

The possibility of horizontal transmission in FIP is generally questioned because (i) the occurrence of FIP is sporadic, and a single cat developing FIP in a multi-cat environment is common [2] ; (ii) the internal mutation theory, which describes that FIPV is a mutant generated from enteric FCoV in one cat [12, 17] ; (iii) there is a lack of evidence of mutant FIPV shedding from FIP cats; and 7  II  II  II  II  II  II  II  II  4250  intact  intact intact intact  intact   8  I I  I  + I I  I I  +  --9  II  I  II  + II  II  II  +  4250  G210*  G210* G210*   10  + +  II  II  II  4250  intact   11  II  II  II  II  +  II  II  II  +  4250  E47*   12  II  II  II  II  + II  II  II  + (iv) the mutation of the 3c gene is unique to each FIP cat [11, 13, 18] . The current belief is that cats that succumb to FIP do not shed and transmit the FIPV to other cats [11, 13, 14, [18] [19] [20] . Our data indicate that this outbreak of FIP was caused by viruses from the same origin. First, all of the FIP losses involved a type II FIPV infection, and the recombination event of these seven type II viruses was mapped to the same site. The recombination sites of the type II viruses currently available in GenBank, i.e., FIPV 79-1146, FCoV 79-1683 and FCoV NTU156, were all unique and occurred independently [9, 10] . Second, the FIPV identified in the three kittens that died within the first two months after the onset of fever harbored an intact 3c gene, whereas the viruses from the cats that survived longer (died four to eight months later) all bore a nonsense mutation, i.e., G210* (cat 9 and 12), E47* (cats 11) and Q218* (cat 13). Because the three nonsense mutations detected in the FIPV from these animals were all located at different sites, the viruses that originally infected these cats should all harbor an intact 3c gene -like the virus recovered from the kittens that succumbed earlier. After infection, point mutations arose during the replication of the virus in the individual cats, giving rise to FIPV with a 3c gene bearing nonsense mutations at different locations. The finding that the viruses that were identified not only in the tissues but also in the fecal samples of two cats (cat 9 and 12) harbored an identical mutation in the 3c gene further confirmed that horizontal transmission had occurred (Table 3) . Taken together, all these findings demonstrated that a highly virulent FIPV had spread from animal to animal in a horizontal manner. This is the first report of a type II FIPV outbreak with evidence of horizontal transmission of a diseaseassociated FCoV. The outbreak of FIP started after introducing five kittens (cat 1, 3, 4, 8 and 10) into this shelter between June and July of 2011. Because the causative type II viruses with the distinct genetic marker in the S gene were confirmed to be a recombinant of feline and canine coronaviruses and some of the kittens that died earlier were found to have been living closely with dogs between being rescued and entering the shelter, any of these kittens could have been the source of this type II virus. Dogs, and especially young dogs, in shelters often shed large amounts of canine coronavirus in their feces and recombination between cat and dog and dog and pig coronaviruses has been well documented [21] [22] [23] . Additionally, these causative type II viruses Effusions  II  II  II   11  Feces  ---II  II   NOC swabs  --I I   Viremia  -----Effusions  +  II   12  Feces  -+  ----------+  I I  I I   NOC swabs  ----------I I  I I   Viremia  ---------II were detected in many excretions and secretions of cats dying of FIP (Table 3) , thus providing a vehicle for catto-cat spreading. Although directly following the first FCoV screening of all the animals in this shelter, cats shedding FCoV were caged separately, and transmission subsequently ceased, the mortality rate for this outbreak was high (28%, 13/46). Three studies regarding outbreak of FIP have been reported previously. In a four-year study conducted in a closed breeding cattery, the average mortality was 17.3% [24] , and in a 10-year study of a closed breeding colony, the mortality was 29.4% (5/17) [25] . Another epidemic study conducted in seven catteries/shelters revealed a > 10% mortality rate [20] . The high incidence of FIP in those closed breeding colonies might be influenced by the genetically predisposed breeding stock. In our study, only several FIP cats in this shelter were siblings, and the others were genetically unrelated. Our study demonstrates that without the influence of genetic predisposing factors, the mortality of FIP can still be high in a closed multi-cat environment as long as the spread of the disease-associated FCoV remains undetected.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms [14, 15] . Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS [14, 15] . Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients [31] . Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation. In addition to lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied with a cytokine storm, which might be lethal particularly in immunocompromised patients. The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou [14, 15] .

Droplet evaporation depends on the time it takes for the droplet to travel from the mouth to a particular position. • The violent cough of patients with respiratory diseases will affect droplet generation and secretions of fluids on airway surfaces and heighten coughing frequency. 38 These factors need to be further quantified. • Further research is also required to assess the probability of viral transmission vs droplet.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently associated with a global pandemic causing coronavirus disease, first noted in December of 2019 in the Wuhan province of China. The resultant disease is termed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) and is characterized by acute respiratory disease and pneumonia. COVID-19 has infected nearly 2 million people and caused nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide with a predilection of older people and/or people having other health issues including, hypertension, diabetes, obesity and other comorbidities (1) (2) (3) . SARS CoV-2 is the third human coronaviruses that appeared for the first time in the 21st century. One of the other two coronaviruses are SARS, which appeared in November of 2002 in China and caused 8,098 infections world-wide and 774 deaths. SARS was effectively contained because apparently the virus, although causing high degree of mortality in infected individuals, was not effectively transmitted from one person-to-the other (4, 5) . The second human coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) appeared in 2013 and caused a limited epidemic of few thousand people, but high death rates of approximately 36% predominantly in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia). The primary source of infection was found to be dromedary camels, although the virus was transmitted from person to person in close proximity in hospital settings (6) (7) (8) (9) .

This was a prospective study conducted under IRB approval with written informed consent. Patients scheduled for the Fontan operation underwent baseline liver US with 2D shear wave elastography (SWE) prior to surgery. Patients then underwent follow-up SWE at 24-96h post-Fontan, hospital discharge (6-8 days post-Fontan), 6-months, and 1-year. For each SWE examination, 10 shear wave speed measurements were obtained in the right hepatic lobe. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize population characteristics. Patient shear wave speed (SWS) data were expressed as medians (mSWS). Results: 23 patients (78% male) were imaged 24-96h postoperative, 20 were imaged at discharge, 15 were imaged at 6-months, and 7 were imaged at 1-year. Mean age at baseline US was 3.8±0.9 years. The most common cardiac lesions were: hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n=11) and tricuspid atresia (n=8). All but two patients underwent extracardiac conduit Fontan. Population median mSWS was 1.28 m/s at baseline, increased to 2.27 m/s postoperative, and remained relatively stable thereafter (1.92 m/s at discharge, 2.17 m/s at 6-months, and 2.02 m/s at 1-year). Median mSWS change from baseline was 1.02 m/s postoperative, 0.73 m/s at discharge, 0.77 m/s at 6 months, and 0.8 m/s at 1 year (all statistically significant, p<0.0001). Changes in mSWS from discharge to 6 and 12 month post-Fontan ultrasound were not statistically significant. There was no significant difference in mSWS at baseline based on cardiac lesion and no significant difference in change in mSWS between baseline and follow up based on surgery type. Conclusions: Fontan palliation of single ventricle congenital heart disease results in immediate and sustained postoperative increases in liver stiffness measured by US 2D SWE that persist for at least one year. Purpose or Case Report: 4D flow MRI with full coverage of the heart and proximal vessels is a powerful tool to understand hemodynamic pathology arising from congenital heart disease (CHD) and subsequent surgery; however, scan times often exceed 10 minutes thereby limiting widespread adoption in pediatrics. Decreasing scan time using compressed-SENSE (CS), a combination of conventional parallel imaging (SENSE) and randomized spatial undersampling, shows promise over SENSE alone. However, both the feasibility and its effect on accurate flow quantification in pediatrics has not been evaluated. This study investigated the feasibility of CS for pediatric 4D flow MRI to quantify flow indices used in risk stratification of CHD such as coarctation or pulmonary regurgitation, in comparison with SENSE. Methods & Materials: 15 patients (15.0±7.3y) with CHD were enrolled. All patients' images were acquired on a Philips Ingenia 3T with CS=6 and separately with SENSE= 2 (phase encode) x 2 (slice), with online reconstruction. Images were processed to remove noise and velocity aliasing. To quantify blood flow, 4 anatomical landmarks were defined for the aorta and 3 were defined for the pulmonary arteries. Peak velocity, systolic flow rate, and net flow rate were computed at each landmark. In addition, based on this data, Qp/Qs was derived. For patients with pulmonary regurgitation or aortic coarctation, regurgitant fraction and maximum peak velocity at the coarctation were quantified. A two-tailed, paired t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of 15 patients, 3 patients had hemi-Fontan circulation or uncorrectable severe aliasing in their images and pulmonary measurements were not included. 2 patients had coarctation and 3 patients had pulmonary regurgitation. CS achieved a reduction in scan time of 30.2% over the SENSE approach (3:47±1:07mins vs. 5:25±1:32mins, respectively). No statistical differences were found for peak velocity, peak flow rate, and net flow (p > 0.08 for all measurements). Qp/Qs showed no statistical differences (p=0.14) with mean values of 1.12±0.24 (CS) and 1.05±0.24 (SENSE). Coarctation velocities were equivalent with a mean difference of 5.6% (subject 1: 1.56m/s vs. ). All imaging was performed on a commercial 3T scanner (Ingenia, Philips Healthcare) using retrospective ECG-gated cine bSSFP. Cine SA images covering both ventricles were acquired with conventional parallel imaging (SENSE = 1.5-2) and a vendor-optimized parallel imaging/compressed sensing approach (compressed SENSE parameters were used (TR/TE/FA: 3 ms/1.5 ms/40-45°; in-plane voxel resolution: 0.9-1.4 mm; 10-14 slices; slice thickness: 6-10 mm; temporal resolution: 30±5 ms [17-40 ms] ). Image quality was scored for blood-myocardial contrast (BMC), edge definition (ED), and presence of artifact (PA) by an experienced radiologist. Quantitative comparisons included LV and RV end systolic volume (ESV), end diastolic volume (EDV), ejection fraction (EF) (Circle CVI42, Calgary). Results: Results: No differences were found with image scores for BMC, ED, and PA (p = 0.67, 0.27, 0.14). No differences were found between LV EDV, ESV, and EF for the two sequences (p = 0.92, 0.77, 0.33) or RV EDV, ESV, and EF (p = 0.18, 0.13, 0.58). Scan duration (not including rest between breath-holds) was 8±2 s/slice for conventional imaging (1min36s±24s total) vs. 4±2 s/slice for CS (54 s±18 s total). With CS, 2-4 slices were acquired per breath-hold, further speeding up acquisition 2-4 times (including rest between breath-holds). Conclusions: Conclusion: Equivalent image quality and cardiac volumes were found between acceleration approaches. The time savings per slice acquisition with CS allowed for a 75% reduction in number of breath-holds (12 vs. 3) without differences in qualitative or quantitative measurements as compared to the conventional technique. These time savings will reduce the number of breath holds and result in and shorter and simpler anesthesia protocols. In a multicentric study from 2013 to 2019, we retrospectively identified 11 patients with a left pulmonary artery sling referred for CT angiography. Demographics, clinical data and outcomes were collected from their medical records. CTA findings were collected by two pediatric radiologists. In all cases, 3D volume-rendered reconstructions plotting the airway and central vessels were obtained. Results: of the 11 patients (median age: 6 months, range: 1-44 months; 6 girls:5 boys), 9 (81.8%) were symptomatic, with shortness of breath and/or stridor at presentation.There were seven patients with type 1 (type 1A: n=5, type 1B: n=2) and 4 patients with type 2 (type 2A: n=3, type 2B: n=1). Seven patients had associated cardiovascular anomalies, including ventricular and atrial septal defects (n=3, each), persistent ductus arteriosus and persistent left superior vena cava (n =2, each), and also one case each of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, pulmonary stenosis, total anomalous pulmonary venous return and foramen oval permeable respectively. The proximal branches of the right pulmonary artery (RPA) had its origin 10 of the 11 cases on the RPA, only one patient showed an anomalous origin of the right middle pulmonary artery from a common orifice between the RPA and LPA. The LPA reanastomosis was performed in 8 patients, including two patients with accompanying tracheoplasties. 2 patients of this series died before surgical correction. Conclusions: Left pulmonary artery sling is an uncommon vascular ring and CT angiography is an accurate method for demonstrating it and its associated cardiovascular anomalies for an optimal presurgical evaluation of LPAS. Purpose or Case Report: AAOCA is the second leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the young which typically occurs with exertion. With in-vitro patient-specific modeling the study aims to assess the differences in fractional flow reserve(FFR)with hyperemia(high-flow)in a patient with AAOCA with a confirmed ischemic event and compare it to a patient with normal coronaries Methods & Materials: Patient-specific flow models were created after segmenting CT data and 3D printed using Agilus a flexible material whose compliance was matched to native aortic tissue from 2 subjects:1)11 year old male with anomalous right coronary artery(RCA)with a 12.3mm intramural course, slit-like ostium and confirmed ischemia on stress testing; 2)16 year old male with normal coronary artery anatomy. The two models were placed in a left heart duplicator under exercise conditions of 90bpm, cardiac output of 5L/min and mean aortic pressure of 100mmHg. RCA flow at baseline was set to account for 30% of 4-5% of the cardiac output. Pressure waveforms were recorded using a Millar catheter starting in the aorta, through ostium and intramural segment into RCA mediastinal segment. FFR was computed as the ratio of distal to aortic pressure. A simulated stress test was performed, increasing the aortic pressure from 100 to 240mmHg to observe effects of pressure-driven anatomical deformation on coronary flow Results: In normal RCA, FFR measurements from the aortic position to the mediastinal segment showed no sign of ischemia(FFR>0.8). In the anomalous RCA, FFR measurements under exercise conditions showed a significant drop in FFR in the middle of the intramural course to<0.6, indicating conditions for ischemia. FFR recovered distal to the intramural segment, but remained<0.8. Exposing the models to the simulated stress illustrated an unhindered increase in coronary flow in response to aortic pressure with the normal model compared with the ischemic AAOCA model, with the latter showing a slope on the flow-pressure curve that was 2.2 times lower than that obtained with the normal coronary Conclusions: Ischemia in AAOCA patients may manifest through dynamic biomechanically driven flow resistance related to the morphological substrate like ostial stenosis and intramural course. In AAOCA with clinically documented ischemia, FFR significantly decreases at the ostium and intramural course, and resistance to flow with increasing aortic pressure increases(absent in normal coronaries). These findings may highlight the mechanisms leading to sudden death in AAOCA Purpose or Case Report: Morphological features including intramural course, high ostial location, and slit-like ostium are considered risk factors for sudden death in patients with AAOCA. Assessment of coronary blood flow at rest and hyperemia may contribute to understanding the cause of death, and to risk stratification and management. A patient-specific biomechanical 3D printed model incorporating morphological features derived from CTA was developed to quantify coronary blood flow in AAOCA. Methods & Materials: IRB approval was obtained. Retrospectively ECG-gated CTA data from an AAOCA subject was used to segment the aortic valve, proximal aorta, and proximal right and left coronary arteries. 3D virtual models were created and exported as .STL format into CAD modeling software to create vessel walls and connections to inflow and outflow pipes. To determine material composition and properties, dog bone samples were designed per ASTM standards, printed with Agilus 30 on a CONNEX 350, and coated with Parylene (PY), polyurethane (PU) or silicone (SI) to create desirable optical and mechanical properties, and compared to fresh pediatric human aorta specimen stored in alcohol on an Instron machine to derive stress/strain curves and dynamic modulus and stiffness values. Aortocoronary pulsatile flow phantoms were designed and 3D printed with Agilus 30, Visijet S500, and silicon molding. The 3D printed model was filled with iodinated contrast, connected to a pulse duplicator, scanned using volumetric CT. Data was subjected to blinded standardized assessment for AAOCA by an expert reader, and compared to original patient dataset. Results: Properties of Agilus 30 coated with polyurethane and silicon at 2mm thickness were found to closely mimic properties of native aorta, with tensile strength ranging between 2.4 and 3.1 MPa. A 0.8 mm intimal wall thickness (WT) for the intramural segment, 1mm WT for the mediastinal coronary, and 2mm WT for the aorta were assigned. There was complete agreement between the CT assessment of the 3D printed model and patient CTA for location of the ostia, branching pattern, ostial stenosis, presence of intramural course and length of intramurality. Dynamic cross-sectional measurements of proximal coronaries in the intramural and mediastinal segments were identical to patient CTA. Conclusions: It is possible to transfer key morphological variables in AAOCA from CTA to a 3D printed model that can be used for biomechanical testing and flow analysis. Methods & Materials: IRB approved retrospective analysis of 28 patients with DMD undergoing clinical CMR from April to October 2019. All subjects scanned on 3T Seimens Skyra with 1) traditional BH, phase sensitive inversion recovery, spoiled gradient echo (BH-SGRE) and 2) FB-MOCO, PSIR, single shot, balanced SSFP sequences in short-axis plane (FB-MOCO), 10-15 minutes after 0.1 mL/kg Gadavist injection for LGE. BH-SGRE slices were acquired over 10-12 heart beats (~50 ms/beat), while FB-MOCO slices were acquired in one heartbeat (~260 ms). Both sequences had spatial resolution of 1.1x1.1x8 mm3. 139 slices were compared for image quality in blinded fashion by two independent readers using Likert scale scoring system of 1-5 (1=non-diagnostic, 5=excellent). Presence of artifacts and DME was similarly assessed. Purpose or Case Report: Portal hypertension is a manifestation of Fontan-related venous congestion and hepatic fibrosis. We studied the prevalence of radiologic evidence of portal hypertension (RP) and its association with Fontan hemodynamics and adverse outcomes. We also tested the validity of the VAST score, used in a prior study, in our population.

The final step of ubiquitination is controlled by E3 Ub ligases (more than 600 members in the human genome), which determine the selectivity of ubiquitination by interacting with both E2Ub and the substrates to which Ub is transferred. Inhibitors of E3-E2 or E3-substrate interactions may thus enable specific targeting of a limited number of proteins, which may translate into a better therapeutic ratio and fewer side effects. To this end, structural studies of E3 ligase substrate-binding surfaces or sites mediating ubiquitination activity and assembly of E3 complexes not only reveal molecular mechanisms, but also facilitate the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors. As discussed above, E3 ligases function by one of two general mechanisms: they either form covalent Ub adducts on their active sites (HECT) or serve as non-covalent adaptors that facilitate the transfer of Ub from E2Ub to substrate (RING and U-box). The three classes of E3 ligases have different protein interaction domains (HECT, RING, and U-box) that bind to E2 enzymes, and other domains recruit substrates [58] [59] [60] . The HECT domain is a 350-residue polypeptide, which adopts a bilobal structure [61] ; the N-terminal lobe contains the E2-binding site and the C-terminal lobe harbors the catalytic cysteine. The lobes are separated by a small linker stretch, forming a cleft with the active site [46] . However, these surfaces are quite shallow and are not well adapted for targeting by small molecules. On the other hand, the RING finger domain is formed by conserved patterns of cysteine and histidine residues that hold two Zn 2+ ions in a conformation referred to as a ''cross-brace'' motif that bind E2 enzymes [62] . Finally, the RING-like U-box family adopts a similar structure but without employing Zn 2+ coordination. One might think that inhibition of a canonical catalytic site (HECT) would be easier than targeting protein-protein interaction domains (RING or U-box), but all reported small molecule inhibitors of E3 ligases target RING-type enzymes (Fig. 1B ).

We propose a tailored model for the epidemic spread of COVID-19. We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [7, 17, 10, 18] .To understand the geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.

Solving the problem of healthcare-associated infections and occupationally acquired infections involves an equation with many complex variables. One of the key components is healthcare workers (HCWs), such as doctors, nurses, laboratory personnel and technical professionals, who are frequently exposed to blood and body fluids. 1, 2 These fluids can transmit bacteria that cause colonization or infection, including multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacteriaceae (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). There is also a risk of transmission of viruses, including noroviruses, respiratory viruses and bloodborne viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses), that can survive for hours or days on surfaces. 1,3e18 In addition to the risk to HCWs acquiring micro-organisms through workplace exposures, HCWs who are already colonized with these microorganisms represent a risk to patients; studies have reported that 2e15% of HCWs are colonized or infected with MRSA. 8,9,15e18 Another consideration is the changes that are occurring in the way that patient care is delivered. While acute care personnel, such as those in hospital operating rooms and emergency departments, anticipate splashes and splatters of blood and body fluids, and use personal protective equipment (PPE) accordingly, new medical technologies allow for performing invasive procedures outside of the acute care environment. It may be more difficult to avoid accidental exposures to blood and body fluids in such settings, PPE may be less accessible, and as HCWs are likely to be working with little or no supervision, they may be less compliant with standard infection control precautions. Thus, HCWs who work in nontraditional settings, such as clinics, and ambulatory and community settings, may be at increased risk of occupational exposure to infectious micro-organisms. In addition, HCWs often travel to and from healthcare facilities by public transportation wearing their work clothing, creating another route by which micro-organisms can be imported into, and exported from, the healthcare environment. 19, 20 Not only are the modes of healthcare changing, but another threat comes from the impact of globalization of travel. Over the years, the emergence of novel infections has revealed gaps in public health preparedness for infectious disease in most countries. For example, in the early 2000s, gaps were identified in the preparedness for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and significant gaps were noted again last year in the responses to both Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). In the USA, this was tragically exemplified by the two HCWs who acquired EVD from one patient who travelled from West Africa to Dallas, Texas. 21 Viruses such as Ebola can be transmitted easily in body fluids to healthy populations. Healthcare facilities may not be prepared to prevent these types of transmissions. A survey of more than 1000 members of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) found that only 6% felt that their hospitals were fully prepared for emerging threats like Ebola, and 20% had yet to begin training their workers. 22 Finally, while considerable effort is placed on cleaning and disinfection of non-porous or high-touch environmental surfaces, much less effort is placed on the procedures for cleaning and decontaminating porous, soft surfaces or healthcare textiles (e.g. privacy curtains, linen, upholstery, patient furniture or room furnishings). These textiles include uniforms, scrub suits and other apparel. The complex role that these textiles play in acquisition and retention of pathogens is further complicated by varied laundering conditions and requirements, including whether or not the employer allows employees to launder their work-related apparel at home. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other government agencies around the world provide guidance for laundering contaminated textiles, achieving optimal water temperature, drying time and dedicated process flow can be difficult to achieve in healthcare facilities, and nearly impossible in homes.

For example, in the early 2000s, gaps were identified in the preparedness for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and significant gaps were noted again last year in the responses to both Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). In the USA, this was tragically exemplified by the two HCWs who acquired EVD from one patient who travelled from West Africa to Dallas, Texas. 21 Viruses such as Ebola can be transmitted easily in body fluids to healthy populations. Healthcare facilities may not be prepared to prevent these types of transmissions. A survey of more than 1000 members of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) found that only 6% felt that their hospitals were fully prepared for emerging threats like Ebola, and 20% had yet to begin training their workers. 22 Finally, while considerable effort is placed on cleaning and disinfection of non-porous or high-touch environmental surfaces, much less effort is placed on the procedures for cleaning and decontaminating porous, soft surfaces or healthcare textiles (e.g. privacy curtains, linen, upholstery, patient furniture or room furnishings). These textiles include uniforms, scrub suits and other apparel. The complex role that these textiles play in acquisition and retention of pathogens is further complicated by varied laundering conditions and requirements, including whether or not the employer allows employees to launder their work-related apparel at home. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other government agencies around the world provide guidance for laundering contaminated textiles, achieving optimal water temperature, drying time and dedicated process flow can be difficult to achieve in healthcare facilities, and nearly impossible in homes.

For any virus, the identification of a mammalian reservoir is highly relevant because the 'fitness valley' that viruses need to cross for the conquest of new hosts is shallow if the hosts are genetically related. 3 Our knowledge of mammalian viruses is fairly opportunistic, focusing on agents of obvious disease in livestock and pets. The range of viruses carried unnoticed by our phylogenetic next of kin may be huge. For instance, wild small mammals including bats and rodents have now been shown to harbor a tremendous spectrum of relatives of human paramyxoviruses-a family that contains the mumps virus, several different respiratory agents and the measles virus. 4 Not all of these have yet been proven to have their cognates in bats, but the sample studied so far is just a tiny fraction of the tremendous bat diversity. Some of these agents have already been suggested to cross-infect humans. 5 That is a worrying perspective because the concept of liberating humankind from some of its most notorious viruses by mass vaccination is essentially dependent on the absence of animal sources from which eradicated viruses could be replenished. 6 The implications of recent findings might even reach into the future agenda of virus eradication: the hepatitis C virus, one of the most important human viruses and a prime candidate for eradication pending vaccine availability, has relatives in companion animals including dogs and horses. 7, 8 These and other recent findings remind us of an important issue in viral reservoir ecology: non-persisting viruses are maintained on a social level, requiring large, dense and interconnected host groups for their perpetual transmission. 9 Human immunodeficiency virus and its ape reservoir with a rather small group size might have been a decoy rather than a paradigm for this field of research because the virus is able to persist in individuals and depends less on efficient transmission for maintenance. On the contrary, candidates for the next pandemic would be agents that are transmitted efficiently and cause acute disease-such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and flu. The novel human coronavirus EMC/2012 with its connection to bats might establish another recent case. 10, 11 Within the class of mammals, bats form the largest contiguous social groups. Their association with pathogenic viruses has been proposed to be due to specific immune functions, 12 but these remain to be proven. Large social group sizes and a migratory lifestyle may suffice to make certain bat species become breeders of viruses. The reliance of bat-borne viruses on transmissibility rather than persistence could explain their high onward transmissibility after host-switching. 13 There are prominent examples of bat-borne viruses that can be passed between humans, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus and the severe acute respiratory syndrome agent. For comparison, we have few examples of rodent-derived viruses that are routinely passed from human to human. Lassa virus may be the only relevant exception, and even there, transmission seems to be possible only under conditions of very close contact.

Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), spreading from Wuhan to worldwide has been emerged since December 2019. Although scientists and researchers have been racing to develop specific therapeutic agents or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since the identification of the agent, either a drug or a vaccine has not been approved to treat or to prevent COVID-19 up to date. On the base of historical experiences, Convalescent Plasma (CP), a passive antibody therapy, has been evaluated as a hopeful and potential therapeutic option since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Immune plasma had been used previously for the treatment of H1N1 influenza virus, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV epidemics successfully. In this scope competent authorities are responsible to set up certain principles and criteria for the collection and clinical use of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP). This document has been prepared to aid both for the convalescent plasma suppliers and the clinicians. The first part encompasses the supply of CCP and the second part lead the clinical use of CCP for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Turkish Ministry of Health developed a guide on collection and clinical use of CCP and created a web-based monitoring system to follow-up the patients treated with convalescent plasma in universal. This follow-up process is thought to be crucial for the creation and development of current and future treatment modalities. This guide would be a pathfinder for clinicians and/or institutions those eager to conduct CCP treatment more effectively.

To obtain a general profile of the case distribution, we first analyzed all the available cases during this COVID-19 outbreak. [16] As shown in Figure 1A , the number of cases remained stable from January 11 to 15, 2020, and the number of new and cumulative cases increased rapidly after January 16. The first death was reported on January 10, and the number of deaths began to increase rapidly from January 17 onwards, with the cumulative number of deaths reaching 213 on January 30 [ Figure 1B ]. [6] After the nucleic acid assay became available, suspected cases waiting for laboratory confirmation could be diagnosed rapidly. [17] After January 19, the number of suspected cases increased rapidly, and about 40% to 50% of these suspected cases were then confirmed [ Figure 1C ]. Before January 19, the number of severe cases remained low, but they increased steadily from January 20 onwards [ Figure 1D ]. Because Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and the virus spread throughout the province quickly, we also analyzed the changes in number of cases in Hubei province. On January 9, 41 cases were first reported, and by January 30, 5806 cases had been reported, accounting for 59.91% (5806/9692) of the total cases in China [ Figure 1E ]. The cumulative number of Figure 1F ]. These data indicated that both the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 disease were the highest in Hubei province. [18] Before January 16, cases were mainly reported in Hubei province. From January 17 onwards, the outbreak spread to many provinces and the number of cases increased rapidly. Therefore, our spatial and temporal analyses used data from January 17 to 30, 2020. The location of each case was extracted from official reports and mapped onto the national map at the city level using ArcGIS. Of the 362 cities, 307 (84.8%, 307/362) had reported cases. In general, the core outbreak area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities had the highest number of cases, followed by cities with a high population which are transportation hubs. Spatial distribution was then analyzed with a Bayesian model using WinBUGS. After nearly 100,000 iterations, the model converged successfully. After the model converged, it was iterated another 110,000 times to obtain parameter estimations. Generally, a ratio close to 1 indicates that the two chain iterative sequences are close, and that the model has a good convergence and is stable [ Figure 2A ]. Using the established model and parameters, hot and cold spots were identified. The results showed that Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan, and Taiwan were hot spots, and Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Chongqing, Hunan, and Guangxi were secondary hot spots. Generally, hot spots clustered in the midwest, and cold spots clustered in the southeast [ Figure 2B ].

Engineering a dimeric transmembrane protein nanoconduit Shiksha Mantri 1 Engineered protein nanopores, such as α-hemolysin (αHL), have found wide use in studying single molecule chemistry, small molecule detection, and DNA sequencing. Coupling other proteins with αHL covalently can extend the scope of the nanopore technology. The absence of native cysteines, robustness to mutagenesis and a flat cap surface make αHL an ideal substrate for protein engineering. We have engineered a new dimer complex, (α7)2, of the αHL heptamer (α7) linked via disulfide bridges in a cap-to-cap orientation. We validated the composition of (α7)2 by heating it up to 95°C, and by treatment with β-mercaptoethanol. The single channel electrical conductance and the currentvoltage (I-V) characteristics were consistent with a longer pore and a symmetric structure of (α7)2. As compared to molecular adapter γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) binding to the α7 β-barrel when added to the trans side of the lipid bilayer only, γ-CD could bind to (α7)2 from both cis and trans sides of bilayer, implying the presence of two β-barrels in (α7)2. The kinetic parameters obtained empirically for γ-CD binding and insertion in liposomes were in good agreement with those predicted by an electrical model, which also quantified the leak conductance through (α7)2. We have also shown that the two transmembrane β-barrels of (α7)2 can insert in two bilayers simultaneously, and small molecules can be transferred from a pico-litre liposome to the other side of a planar lipid bilayer. Vesicles have been modelled as minimal cells when used in conjunction with α7 pores by allowing small molecule exchange with the external buffer. (α7)2 could be used to connect vesicles to build multi-compartment cellular assemblies/ prototissues. Protein fractions (albumin, globulin, glutelin, and prolamin) were sequentially prepared from Brassica napus (canola grade), Sinapis alba, and two industrial canola meal samples, according to the classical Osborne method (OSB), based on their solubilities in water, 5% NaCl, 0.1 M NaOH and 70% ethanol. These extracts were then compared to the glutelin fraction obtained by direct alkaline extraction method (DIR) in terms of protein yield, recovery, and residual antinutritional components. The OSB method was found to be more effective for protein extraction which resulted in a higher cumulative protein yield and recovery of watersoluble protein fractions, although the DIR method produced a glutelin fraction of higher protein content or purity. Disregarding of extraction method used industrial toasted meal had significantly low protein extractability. Phenolic compounds were observed in all the extracted protein fractions although sinapine, the major phenolic compound in canola, was present only in the albumin fractions. Glucosinolate content of all extracts was below the detection limit (<3 μmol/g). The breakdown products of glucosinolates were minimal in extracts from canola grade meal (1.28 ± 0.16 µmol/g or less), in comparison to those prepared from Sinapis alba meal which, in general contained higher level of residual antinutritional components. Residue-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into cellular proteins allows discrimination of new proteins from old; labeled proteins can be selectively conjugated to purification tags, enriched by affinity chromatography, and identified by mass spectrometry. This method, termed bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), is an attractive approach for the selective identification of proteins produced by a cell in response to biological cues. In this work we combined the BONCAT approach with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), to develop a proteomic technique capable not only of enriching but also of quantifying the subset of newly synthesized proteins produced during an ncAA pulse. Armed with this method, we conducted a proteomic search for direct regulatory targets of the E. coli small RNA CyaR, a Crp-activated regulatory RNA involved in cell metabolism and quorum sensing. Following expression of either CyaR or a negative RNA control, we pulse-labeled cultures with azidohomoalanine (Aha), a methionine surrogate, for 15 minutes. Aha-labeled proteins were conjugated to an alkynyl-biotin affinity tag by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, purified on streptavidin resin, and analyzed by LC/MS-MS. By comparing the relative abundances of proteins produced in the CyaR and control cultures, we identified three known CyaR protein targets and a set of 26 candidate proteins as significantly up or down-regulated. A regulatory RNA assay with target-GFP fusions verified a subset of the candidate proteins as directly regulated by CyaR. Support for this work was provided by the National Institutes of Health.

The governing equations (Eqns. 13-18) manifest that several physical mechanisms are coupled during the evaporation process. The internal energy of the droplet undergoes variation primarily due to evaporative mass loss and sensible enthalpy change, resulting in change in its temperature. The evaporation is driven by the vapor concentration gradient from the droplet surface to the far field. The partial pressure of water vapor at the droplet surface is determined by the surface temperature and solvent (water) mole-fraction at the droplet surface, while its surface temperature T s is determined by Eqn. 15. The far field vapor concentration, on the other hand, is ascertained by the ambient condition, (temperature and relative humidity, RH), which in the case of Covid-19 corresponds to specific geographical locations. It is obvious that for lower ambient temperatures, i.e. T s,0 > T ∞ , the droplet should undergo rapid cooling from its initial value. The droplet temperature, however, should eventually reach a steady state limit (wet bulb). This limit is such that the droplet surface temperature will be always lower than the ambient, implying a positive temperature gradient or heat input. The heat subsequently transferred from the ambient to the droplet surface after attaining wet bulb limit is used completely for evaporating the drop without any change in sensible enthalpy. For a droplet with pure water, i.e. no dissolved non-volatile content, the mole-fraction of solvent at surface remain constant at 100% and at the limit of steady state, the droplet evaporation can be written in terms of the well-known D 2 law

In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24 January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t)>1 to R(t)<1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March 2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction number at R(t)<1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t)>1. Thus, it may be wise to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.

The potential to learn to face fear without either repressing it or else acting it out is particularly relevant in view of the current COVID-19 virus disease, whose repercussions in a range of different sections of society have led to a proliferation of fear and anxiety. The magnitude and quick spread of the pandemic threatens to result in mental destabilization of a considerable part of the population worldwide, resulting in feelings of helplessness in view of the sometimes drastic changes in living situations, the breakdown of social structures long taken for granted, an overall sense of isolation, and of course the ultimate fear: death. These effects, which tend to be further increased by social contagion when anxiety spreads from one person to another, can range from depression and panic attacks to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, psychosis, and even suicidality.

Corona virus is one of the most harmful and pathogenic viruses that humans and animals have ever known. It specially attacks the human respiratory system. Corona virus is an infectious virus, which can be transmitted from an animal to a human and also from a human to another. The virus can be transmitted from an infected person to other people through the air, due to sneezes and coughs, and through direct contact with an infected individual via touching or greeting by hand.

Corona virus is one of the most harmful and pathogenic viruses that humans and animals have ever known. It specially attacks the human respiratory system. Corona virus is an infectious virus, which can be transmitted from an animal to a human and also from a human to another. The virus can be transmitted from an infected person to other people through the air, due to sneezes and coughs, and through direct contact with an infected individual via touching or greeting by hand. Contaminated places with the disease can also transmit the virus when touched. However, WHO is trying to stop this disease by insisting on some recommendations.

Although the major clinical manifestations presented by MERS patients are associated with the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea during the course of illness were also observed quite frequently (35%) [25] [26] [27] 33] . This triggers questions regarding the use of stools to diagnose MERS-CoV. Again, availability of data is too limited for a comparative analysis with other coronaviruses. In the UAE patient who was first treated in an Abu Dhabi hospital on March 19, and later hospitalized in Germany, stool samples tested borderline positive at days 12 and 16 after the onset of symptoms ( Fig. 2A, patient B) . Later stool samples from patients F from KSA and G, a patient transferred from Qatar to the UK, were negative by RT-PCR [25, 28, 31] .

What questions must be answered to show whether HCoV-EMC is likely to cause an epidemic or adapt to become endemic in humans? First, it is necessary to prove whether the HCoV-EMC cultured from the first patient actually caused his fatal disease (7) . Several bacterial pathogens were also cultured from his respiratory tract, although this is not uncommon in severely ill patients on respirators. Development of an animal model for HCoVinduced respiratory disease would fulfill Koch's postulates and be useful for testing candidate coronavirus drugs and vaccine strategies. Sera from humans in the Middle East and elsewhere are being tested by ELISA for HCoV-EMC-specific antibodies to determine the prevalence of infection of humans in different regions and estimate the percentage of clinically apparent HCoV-EMC infections and the case/fatality ratio. Surveillance of bats and other animals in the Middle East and elsewhere for the presence of RNA from betacoronavirus lineage c viruses or antibodies to these viruses will help to identify reservoir hosts and possible intermediate hosts that could transmit the virus to humans. So far, no epidemiological connections have been found between animals and the HCoV-EMC patients. This virus is apparently much less easily transmitted from human to human than SARS-CoV, although three of the cases in Saudi Arabia were within one family and several health care workers who cared for two of the confirmed cases in Jordan also developed pneumonia and are now considered probable cases (5) . It is possible that as the virus replicates in sporadic cases, mutations, particularly in the genes encoding the spike protein and any immunomodulatory proteins, might be selected that increase human-to-human transmissibility. Sporadic HCoV-EMC infections in epidemiologically unlinked individuals in the Middle East suggest that it is a zoonotic virus. Where encounters between humans and wildlife have become common, sporadic zoonotic infections may occur without human-to-human transmission. This so-called "virus chatter" was obvious in retrospective studies of SARS-CoV infections in China which showed that isolated cases occurred well before the virus began to spread from human to human during the SARS pandemic (8) (9) (10) . Mutations in the SARS-CoV spike protein and other viral proteins were associated with the transition from "chatter" to epidemic. It is possible that HCoV-EMC is not yet a human-adapted virus and has simply been detected in rare cases of "chatter" by increasingly sophisticated surveillance. The work by van Boheemen et al. demonstrates the ability of state-of-the-art technology and bioinformatics to obtain full-genome sequence data within days and provide critical insight into the potential risks associated with novel viral pathogens (6) . Over the past decade, other advances, including the development of enhanced virus detection technologies, surveillance programs, increased global awareness and communication through Internet-based technologies such as ProMed, real-time sharing of genome sequences in GenBank, and Internet-based publications and the posting of publications in advance of printing, as well as increasing collaborations between researchers and medical and veterinary practitioners such as the One Health Initiative, have greatly facilitated rapid and effective responses to threats of new emerging infectious diseases.

A previous study showed that ACE2 is expressed in the CNS under physiological conditions (Hamming et al. 2004) . It is unknown whether ACE2 expression is induced under pathological conditions such as SARS-COV-2 infection. Because of the existence of ACE2 in the CNS, it is possible to induce SARS-CoV-2 invasion via ACE2 on the neuronal cell membrane and cause brain injury and neurological symptoms. According to a previous study on coronavirus, the S1 unit of the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus binds to the neuronal ACE2 receptor and attaches to the surface of target cells; then, the serine protease TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein, and the virus enters the neuron (Hoffmann et al. 2020 ). In addition, endothelial cells of blood vessels have high expression of ACE2, and SARS-CoV-2 infection can attack endothelial cells in the cerebral blood vessels through the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in increased permeability of the BBB, cerebral edema, and intracranial hypertension. Furthermore, a disrupted BBB may promote invasion into brain tissues and neurons as depicted in Fig. 1a, b . This pattern of CNS invasion was confirmed for other coronaviruses (Bleau et al. 2015; Cowley and Weiss 2010) . A previous study identified the presence of SARS-CoV in the hypothalamus and cortical neurons of patients with SARS (Ding et al. 2004 ). In addition to invasion by blood vessels, viruses may enter the CNS through the terminals of the olfactory nerve (Arbour et al. 1999) . Importantly, axonal transport also supports the rapid spread from neuron to neuron (Dubé et al. 2018) . A recent study showed that almost no virus particles were detected in nonneuronal cells in infected brain areas . Therefore, brain damage may also be caused by cytokines secreted from infected neurons, especially when the virus invades the nervous system in susceptible individuals with low immunity to this virus (Desforges et al. 2014; Skinner et al. 2019 ). However, these speculations need additional investigation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and are genetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Li, 2016) . The former two genera primarily infect mammals, whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds (Tang et al., 2015) . Six kinds of human CoVs have been previously identified. These include HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, which belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus; and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which belong to the Beta-coronavirus genus (Tang et al., 2015) . Coronaviruses did not attract worldwide attention until the 2003 SARS pandemic, followed by the 2012 MERS and, most recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreaks (China CDC, 2020; Song et al., 2019) . SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are considered highly pathogenic (Cui et al., 2019) , and it is very likely that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from bats to palm civets (Guan et al., 2003) or dromedary camels (Drosten et al., 2014) , and finally to humans (Cui et al., 2019) .

Soft fruits that are eaten raw or lightly heat-treated are frequently causes of outbreaks of viral illnesses. As examples, frozen raspberries have caused NoV outbreaks in Finland, Denmark, Sweden and France (Little and Gillespie, 2008) , and, in 2012, Germany experienced their biggest foodborne NoV outbreak ever caused by frozen strawberries implicated in outbreaks that involved 500 institutions with 11 000 cases (Anonymous, 2012). Even though several viruses such as enterovirus, human rotavirus, adenovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, coronaviruses or aichi virus appear capable of causing foodborne illness or emerging as foodborne pathogens, all recent data show that hepatitis A virus (HAV) and NoV continue to be the most common viral pathogens causing foodborne illness (Yadav et al ., 2010) . Statistical data have shown that HAV is a higher health risk than other pathogens such as Salmonella Typhi, Shigella sonnei or Staphylococcus aureus because of the number of deaths caused by HAV outbreaks (Todd et al ., 2009) . Besides the risk that soft fruits can be contaminated with viruses during growth, the role that food workers play in the spread of illness has been assessed in HAV and NoV outbreaks in which over 50% of the cases were hospitalized. Bidawid et al. determined that 9% of HAV and nearly 18% of a NoV surrogate, feline calicivirus (FCV), could be transferred from artifi cially contaminated fi nger pads to lettuce by contacts during food handling. When studying the opposite route of transmission, they found that 14% of FCV could be transferred from lettuce to bare hands (Bidawid et al. , 2004 (Bidawid et al. , , 2000a . This ease of reversible viral transfer between workers and produce was later supported in a fi eld study (León-Félix et al. , 2010) evaluating the impact of harvesting and packinghouse operations on the contamination of green bell pepper with NoV. When testing the workers' hands for NoV before and after 3 hours of work, they were able to show a change in the rates of positivity of 0% to 14% for pickers, 53% to 33% for classifi ers and 45% to 25% for packers. Although these data are for fresh produce, similar viral transmission is expected to occur during soft fruit production because of the similar practices of picking.

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that can infect animals and humans and cause res-2 piratory distress; they may be as mild as a cold or as severe as pneumonia. In rare cases, animal [1, 27] . Another important and newer breed is the Coronavirus MERS virus, 6 which was discovered in 2012 in the Middle East. The virus was first transmitted from camels to of the disease is a virus, antibiotics do not affect the pathogen. In medical centers, without any specific treatment for the disease, they usually treat the symptoms and make the patient feel more 19 comfortable. 20 As it has been mentioned, the main method of transmission of the disease is the respiratory 21 droplets that a person secretes when coughing. The risk of COVID-19 disease is diminished by 22 someone asymptomatic. But many people with the disease have only slight symptoms. This is 23 especially true in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, COVID-19 can be infected by a person 24 who suffers from a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the 25 transmission period of COVID-19 and the method of isolation and other measures for controlling 26 the spread of 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 20, 26, 28] .

The helical nucleocapsid is believed to be composed of viral RNA and the nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein protein (P), large polymerase protein (L), and transcriptional enhancer protein (M2-1). 14 The 3 nucleocapsid proteins N, P, and L are likely involved with viral replication and transcription. M2-1 and M2-2 proteins of Pneumovirinae are regulatory proteins, functioning as a transcriptional elongation factor (M2-1) and a promoter of viral assembly (M2-2) in RSV. 15 hMPV strains lacking M2-2 have more frequent point mutations and display upregulated transcription, supporting the role of M2-2 as a regulator of viral transcription. 16 The matrix protein (M) surrounds the nucleocapsid within the lipid envelope, and likely facilitates the connection of nucleocapsids with the viral lipid envelope. 14, 15 Van Den Hoogen separated hMPV into 2 lineages based on sequence homology. The distinct lineages, now called hMPV type A and B, have been identified in multiple phylogenic studies, and each type is further grouped into 2 subtypes, called A1, A2, B1, and B2. 9, [17] [18] [19] [20] Overall genetic identity between types is more than 80%, whereas amino acid sequence identity is more than 90%. 17, 19, 20 hMPV type A and B grouping is concordant based on sequence diversity between genes encoding for N, M, F, G, and L proteins, although the extent of sequence diversity varies. 17, 19, 21 Subtypes A1, A2, B1, and B2 are distinguished by diversity between gene sequences for the surface glycoproteins G and F. Identity of the F genes between subtypes within groups A and B is 94% to 96%, whereas identity between G gene sequences is 76% to 83%. 17, 19 EPIDEMIOLOGY Humans are the only known natural host for hMPV. The virus is presumably spread from person to person by respiratory droplets similar to other paramyxoviruses, although this has not been definitively determined. 22 hMPV infection has been detected worldwide, with reports from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. 20, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Serologic studies of stored specimens indicate that hMPV has infected humans for at least 5 decades. 3 hMPV infection is seasonal, with winter epidemics occurring from December to April in the northern hemisphere, simultaneous with or slightly later than RSV epidemics (Fig. 2) . 26, 39, [41] [42] [43] All 4 subtypes of hMPV usually circulate in the same season, and the predominant serotype may alternate in consecutive years in the same location. 20, 42, 44, 45 Whereas Agapov and colleagues 21 found a shift in predominance (>80% of isolates) from type B to type A in St Louis, Missouri, USA, Mackay and colleagues 46 detected a shift in predominant subtype (>50% of isolates) from A1 to A2 in Queensland, Australia in sequential years. hMPV is most commonly a disease of young children, causing approximately 5% to 10% of LRTI in infants, and in some studies it is the second leading cause of bronchiolitis after RSV. 35, 41, [47] [48] [49] Multiple methods of evaluating seroprevalence have shown that more than 90% of children have evidence of prior hMPV infection by the age of 5 years. 3,50-52 The peak age of hMPV infection ranges from 5 to 22 months, typically older than that of RSV, younger than that of influenza, and with a more even distribution among age groups. 41, 42, 45, 47, [53] [54] [55] In 1 study of potential risk factors for viral infection, hMPV and coronavirus showed a stronger association to childcare attendance than RSV, picornaviruses, influenza viruses, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses. 39 Young healthy adults have a higher yearly hMPV infection rate, ranging from 4% to 15%, than do elderly or high-risk adults, perhaps because of more frequent contact with children. 56 Yearly seroconversion rates in patients more than 65 years old living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) is up to 12%, and in 1 hMPV outbreak among elderly patients in an LTCF the mortality in confirmed cases was 50%. 57,58 hMPV seroprevalence was found to be 83% among adults with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 59

Abstract Objectives The outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has currently become a global concern. The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread. Methods We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics. Results Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17 to 20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23 to 24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei. Conclusions The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.

Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the pathogen to cause pneumonia in Wuhan, China , which was temporarily named as 2019-nCoV by WHO. 1, 2 On 11 February 2020, based on the phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, 2019-nCoV was officially named as SARS-CoV-2, 3 and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named as COVID-19 . 4 Evidence has proven that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets and close contact , posing a huge challenge on the public health. 5 Up to now, there were more than seventy thousand confirmed cases and two thousand death case in 30 countries around the world. 6 The main manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, dry cough, weakness, and breathing difficulty. Abnormal liver functions were frequently reported extrapulmonary clinical feature and almost one half of patients experienced different degrees of liver function damage. 7, 8 .According to the recent study of single-cell RNA-seq , angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE)2 was highly expressed not only in type II alveolar epithelial cells, but also in bile duct cells. 9 Importantly, recent study confirmed that the cell entry receptor of 2019-nCoV, like SARS-CoV, is ACE2 receptor. 10 All these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the bile duct cells and cause the abnormal liver function in these patients. However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the bile duct injury related index, was not specific in COVID-19 patients . 7, 8 .A recent pathological finding reported that moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity were present in liver biopsy specimens, indicating that the liver injury could be caused by either SARS-CoV-2 infection or drug-induced liver injury. 11 Currently, however, there is no any clinical research to analyze whether abnormal liver function in COVID-19 patients is due to the drugs used or not. Given the high contagious and pathogenic capacities of SARS-CoV-2 and high incidence of liver damage, an analysis with liver function in COVID patients is urgently warranted.

For the third time in less than 20 years there is global concern about a novel coronavirus causing significant respiratory morbidity and mortality. The first cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) were reported by China to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2003; one-third of these were among healthcare workers (WHO, 2003). By the end of the outbreak in 2004, more than half (378; 57%) of the 667 SARS cases treated in Asian and Canadian outbreak hospitals were healthcare workers or medical students (Sepkowitz and Eisenberg, 2005). At the time of and for many years after the SARS outbreak, there was much consternation among the medical and infectious disease communities about the organism's mode(s) of transmission. Aerosols (both fine particles and larger droplets) had to be at least partially responsible for the relative ease with which SARS was transmitted from person to person. As more detailed epi-demiologic data were published, this proved to be the case-risk factors for nosocomial transmission of SARS included exposure during aerosol-generating medical procedures, failure to isolate infectious patients, and the lack or uneven use of personal protective equipment (Scales et al., 2003; Fowler et al., 2004; Ofner-Agostini et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009). In May 2014, when the first cases of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) were reported in the USA 2 years after initial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, Dr Rachael Jones and I published a Commentary on the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Practice website (Brosseau and Jones, 2014). We argued that MERS was likely an aerosol-transmissible disease, because it resulted in symptoms similar to SARS (cough, diarrhea, and vomiting) and patients would likely undergo aerosol-generating procedures, such as intub-ation and bronchoscopy. As with SARS, early data suggested aerosol transmission of MERS among hospital patients located at some distance from each other. As with SARS, the MERS coronavirus remains viable as an aerosol and on surfaces for long periods of time at low relative humidity. We argued that healthcare workers should be provided with fit-tested N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), at a minimum, when caring for MERS patients. For exposures to high concentrations of infectious particles, such as from patients experiencing severe symptoms or during aerosol-generating procedures , we recommended that healthcare workers should be wearing powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), which offer a higher degree of protection than FFRs. At the time of our Commentary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was recommending contact, droplet, and airborne precautions for MERS; WHO was recommending only contact and droplet precautions. The WHO guidance for MERS, updated in October 2019, now recommends respirators and well-ventilated negative pressure rooms for aerosol-generating procedures (WHO, 2019). While this is a small step forward, the WHO guidance continues to recommend surgical masks for healthcare workers when caring for hospitalized MERS patients.

We have created a system to analyze and visualize the disease data in Hubei Province and the rest of China, to help decision makers and the public make rational decisions without requiring data analysis expertise.

GTases are members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which also includes DNA and RNA ligases [21] . The crystal structures of various family members revealed a common tertiary structure consisting of an N-terminal NT domain and a Cterminal OB-fold domain [22, 23, 53, 54, 55] . Based on both the sequence and structural similarities between GTases and DNA/ RNA ligases (Fig. 6A and B) , it is tempting to speculate that MPA might also be an inhibitor of DNA/RNA ligases. DNA/RNA ligation entails three sequential nucleotidyl transfer steps, and the first two steps are mechanistically related to the GTase reaction [56] . In the first step of the ligation reaction, nucleophilic attack on the a-phosphorus of ATP by ligase results in the formation of a covalent ligase-adenylate intermediate with the concomitant release of pyrophosphate. In the second step, AMP is transferred to the 59-end of the 59-phosphate-terminated DNA strand to form a DNA-adenylate complex. In the last step of the reaction, The the polynucleotides are joined with the concomitant release of AMP [56] . To verify the potential ability of MPA to inhibit DNA/RNA ligases, we have monitored the effect of MPA on the purified DNA ligase encoded by Chlorella virus. The ability of MPA to inhibit the complete ligation reaction was monitored by incubating the purified enzyme with ATP and a DNA duplex containing a centrally located nick. The reaction products were then analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As can be seen in Fig. 7A , the presence of increasing concentrations of MPA significanlty decreased strand joining by the Chlorella virus DNA ligase. MPA was shown to inhibit the strand-joining activity by 50% at 700 mM. We next set out to investigate which of the first two catalytic steps of the ligation reaction is inhibited by MPA. The first step of the reaction, i.e. the formation of the enzyme-AMP covalent intermediate, was monitored by incubating the purified enzyme in the presence of [alpha-32 P]ATP. The radiolabeled covalent enzyme-AMP complex was then visualized by autoradiography following electrophoresis on a denaturant polyacrylamide gel. Similarly to what was observed in the case of the GTase activity, our results indicate that very high concentrations of MPA are required to inhibit the first step of the reaction, i.e. the formation of the enzyme-AMP covalent complex (Fig. 7B) . We determined that a concentration of ,3.0 mM of MPA is required to inhibit the first step of the ligation reaction by 50%, a concentration that corresponds to 4times the amount required to inhibit the overall reaction. The effect of MPA on the second step of the ligation reaction (i.e. the transfer of the AMP from ligase-adenylate to a 59-phosphate terminus acceptor DNA) was next evaluated. In a typical ligation reaction, the adenylate-DNA intermediate would not be detected since the enzyme is highly efficient in ligating the two DNA strands [57] . However, as reported previously [58] , the adenylate-DNA intermediate can accumulate to high levels when the enzyme acts on a substrate that contains a 1-nt gap between the reactive 39-OH and 59-phosphate strands. Using such an approach, the incubation of the enzyme with ATP and a gapped DNA substrate resulted in the conversion of the 59-radiolabeled 18-mer strand into an adenylated species (AppDNA) that migrated 1-nt slower than the input 18-mer during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7C) . The ability of MPA to inhibit this second step of the ligase reaction was investigated by pre-incubating the enzyme with ATP to ensure formation of the covalent enzyme-AMP complex, and by incubating the complex in the presence of the ligation substrate that contains a 1-nt gap between the reactive 39-OH and 59phosphate strands. Using this strategy, it was determined that a concentration of 600 mM of MPA is sufficient to inhibit 50% of the second step of the ligation reaction (Fig. 7C) . Taken together, these results indicate that MPA inhibits the ligation reaction mainly through inhibition of the second step of the reaction, i.e. the catalytic transfer of the AMP moiety onto the 59-phosphate terminus of the nicked DNA substrate.

In December of 2019, the city of Wuhan, located in the Hubei province of China, became the epicenter of an outbreak of a pneumonia of unknown cause. This pneumonia was later confirmed to be secondary to infection by a novel coronavirus. This virus was originally called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), but on February 11, 2020, the disease was named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO), and the virus was named "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It is believed that the COVID-19 outbreak has a zoonotic origin and began in the Huanan wet seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. SARS-CoV-2 has proven to be extremely contagious and spreads easily from person to person. Cases of COVID- 19 have now spread beyond Wuhan to many other provinces in China as well as other countries, which has raised international attention and concern. As of March 12, 2020, more than 81,000 human infections with SARS-CoV-2 and at least 3100 deaths related to COVID-19 have been confirmed in China alone. Although the epidemic situation in China has been relatively under control, the situation outside China is getting worse. So far, the COVID-19 viral disease that has swept into at least 114 countries with more than 60,000 cases diagnosed and more than 4000 people killed is now officially a pandemic, as WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced in Geneva on March 11. At first, COVID-19 appeared in a few clusters and was more likely to affect persons with advanced age or other comorbidities, but it is now more widespread. Infection can result in severe pneumonia and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1, 2] . The main clinical presentation includes fever, dry cough, fatigue, and malaise and/or non-specific upper respiratory tract infection symptoms that may not be particularly noticeable. As previously reported [1] , patients with severe illness can develop dyspnea and some even developed ARDS and required ICU admission and oxygen therapy. Laboratory findings of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 include lymphopenia, elevated CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of point-of-care real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tests specific for COVID-19 [3, 4] . Novel coronavirus nucleic acids are detected in throat swabs, sputum, lower respiratory tract secretions, and blood. At present, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is primarily based on the patient's epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, chest imaging findings, and etiological evidence. Viral nucleic acid testing is an important diagnostic criterion; however, it has some limitations. False negatives from viral nucleic acid testing arise from the uneven quantity of detection technology, disease characteristics (asymptomatic patients), and status of epidemic prevention and control, as well as errors in clinical sampling [5] . COVID-19 is highly contagious; thus, early detection and diagnosis are of paramount importance to isolate suspected cases and contacts to control the outbreak. The challenges in identification of pathogens by viral nucleic acid testing have made some frontline clinicians propose CT as a diagnostic method for identifying COVID-19 patients. This review aims to briefly introduce the novel coronavirus pneumonia and highlight the value of imaging in its diagnosis.

To predict new zoonotic coronavirus jumps across species and to understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has intrinsic genetic variability, which results in a high mutation rate. Moreover, coronaviruses have the largest genomes (ϳ30 kb) among RNA viruses. However, part of their sequence encodes a proofreading 3= exonuclease that can increase replication fidelity (13) . It has been suggested that any adaptation in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting from person to person might also increase its virulence (14) . However, this mechanism could lead to a genetic bottleneck, known as Muller's ratchet, which could significantly decrease viral fitness (15) . Muller's ratchet predicts that, when mutation rates are high and a significant proportion of mutations are deleterious, a type of irreversible ratchet mechanism gradually reduces the mean fitness of small populations of asexual organisms. Because genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions, the SARS-CoV-2 is expected to become less virulent through human-to-human transmissions (16) .

Because of the resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-like coronaviruses, bats are likely to act as natural reservoir hosts of the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen et al., 2020) . It is established that SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civet to humans (Wang et al., 2006) and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans, yet the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. The genome sequence analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has the closest relative SARS-like SLCoV/RaTG13, found in horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) from Yunnan, China (Zhou et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% overall genome sequence identity to SARS-like coronavirus SLCoV/RaTG13 (Zhou et al., 2020) . Therefore, the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 could be the horseshoe bat. Recent evidence suggests pangolins as host candidates (Lam et al., 2020) , however, the host pangolins are not firmly determined. Not all bat SARS-like CoV can infect humans. For example, bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) found in 2017 (Zhou et al., 2018) , caused millions of piglet deaths, but no human cases. We may postulate that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from its progenitor through mutations and evolutionary fitness in the host-shift and adapting. SARS-CoV-2 are fast-evolving pathogens that continuously undertake mutations in the generations of infection of the host (Yin, 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020) . This fact suggests that SARS-CoV-2 had evolved mutations in critical proteins and genome structures prior to establishing human infection. To understand how SARS-CoV-2 jumps from animals to adaptively infect humans is important to the surveillance of virus evolution and diversity, therefore ultimately controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and preventing future SARS-like outbreaks.

The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak originating from Wuhan, China, poses a threat to global health. While it's evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool. 23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential fecal-oral transmission route.

A very important fact that was not considered in Section 2 is that there is a very large number of stray dogs in China. It was reported that at least 18.2% of the human rabies cases in Guangdong Province are caused by stray dogs [79] . In Section 3 , taking this fact into consideration and using rabies data from Guangdong Province, we proposed a SEIV model for the dog-human transmission of rabies in which both domestic and stray dogs are considered. By the analysis of the model, we concluded that the cases of rabies in Guangdong would decrease gradually in the next a few year and increase slightly afterward, which indicates that rabies cannot be controlled or eradicated under the current strategies. By carrying out some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number in terms of various parameters, we found that the vaccination rate of domestic dogs, the recruitment rate of domestic dogs, the number of stray dogs and the valid time of the immunity play very important roles for the transmission of rabies. From Fig. 3.5 (a) , we can see that the acute infection in humans in Guangdong Province would be reduced evidently through the decrease of the stray dog population. Moreover, reducing the transfer from infected domestic dogs to stray dogs is more effective than decreasing domestic dogs that are abandoned. As shown in Fig. 3.4 (a) and Fig. 3.5 (b) , rabies can be controlled with the vaccination coverage rate over 75% which is a little bit higher than the recommended vaccination rate by WHO, the main reason is that a large number of stray dogs exists in most areas of Guangdong Province. However, from Fig. 3.5 (b) , although acute infection cases can be reduced by culling stray dogs, rabies cannot be eventually eradicated by this measure alone. Therefore, culling stray dogs is not a good strategy in controlling rabies. To prevent and control rabies in stray dogs, as suggested in Section 2 , fostering of stray dogs could be introduced and encouraged, food baits containing abortifacient oral vaccine in capsules could be distributed in order to reduce the stray dog population and vaccinate stray dogs.

Ribavirin is sometimes used for documented RSV infections of the lower respiratory tract in transplant recipients. Metapneumovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are emerging pathogens in transplantation patients. The clinical spectrum of disease from metapneumovirus ranges from symptomatic (even fatal) to asymptomatic cases. Some groups have suggested a possible correlation with graft rejection in lung transplant recipients. Diagnosis is often made using molecular assays; the full impact of this infection in transplantation is yet to be realized. SARS, caused by a zoonotic coronaviruses, is a highly contagious and rapidly progressive form of viral pneumonia, which spread from Asia to many parts of the world in early 2003. A number of transplantation patients were infected, some of whom died. The impact of SARS and resulting infection control issues was significant for both active organ transplantation (i.e., concerns about transmitting donorderived infections) as well as routine follow-up care for transplantation patients, some of who deferred healthcare visits.

Many books have been written on nuclear transfers from one nation to another nation. My favorite reference for the technical details on nuclear technology transfer is the book, by Joe Cirincioni, Jon Wolfsthal and Miriam Rajkumar, entitled Deadly Arsenals: Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Threats (2nd Edition, 2005) published by the Carnegie Endowment Press. Each of these stories make fascinating reading. How did A.Q. Kahn take secrets from the Urenco centrifuge plant in the Netherlands to Pakistan? Why was the West so slow to take action on their intelligence that he was taking secrets? How was Kahn protected by the Pakistani government while he took trips to Lybia, Iran, Iraq and North Korea, hree said yes and Saddam Hussain said no. Why was the U.S. so slow to react? Why did Pakistan's Prime Minister Pervez Musharraf give Kahn a light sentence of house arrest. Any why did he make his statement in English and not Urdu. And so on. An excellent reference of the broader history of global proliferation is Stephanie Cooke's In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age (Bloomsbury 2009). Our purpose is Physics of Societal Issues is primarily to confine us to the technical issues, which must be mastered if nuclear proliferation is to be controlled. We need both right and left brains, but in this case, the left brain holds both history and physics. Since Physics of Societal Issues is a technical book, let us not repeat much of the proliferation history, rather let us refer you to Cirincioni, Wolfstahl and Rajkumar and to Cooke. Let the professor assign you these topics for the seminar part of the course. These books are excellent! In lecturing on these topics since 1972 in what is now called, Nuclear Proliferation in the Post-9/11 World, I have used two approaches to cover the broader and important historical events. To study from the chronologies in Appendices A and B of this book is like drinking from a fire hose. We loose some students with this rapid march, but we have no choice. This is a technical book and technical courses are taught from these pages. The students are required to prepare papers and participate in debates on these issues, but I do not cover them in class. One-way to gain fast entry to these broad topics is to prepare a schematic that displays the multidimensioned aspects of proliferation policy. This I have done below in Fig. 5 .6. Bill Broad presented a similar schematic (we did this independently) in the December 9, 2008 issue of the New York Times. Broad's approach has the advantage that he readily presents the time of events. My approach lists more details, while writing the important dates.

Therefore, exploring potential risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 is crucial for delay or halt the progression of the disease. Previous studies have revealed that patients with old age and underlying diseases are more likely to be aggravated (Wang D. et al., 2020 , Wang Z. et al., 2020 , and aberrant immune-inflammatory response and cytokine storm may played an important role in the disease progression (Zhou Yonggang et al., 2020) .

Increasingly convincing evidence indicates that various human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases, are directly related to the excessive accumulation of aggregated or misfolded proteins in cells [1] [2] [3] [4] . Therefore, it is important to maintain the homeostatic balance between protein synthesis and degradation in eukaryotic cells. It is generally accepted that eukaryotic organisms have developed the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosome system (ALS) for selective degradation of structurally abnormal proteins in cells [5, 6] . The UPS is responsible for the degradation of most cytosolic short-lived proteins and misfolded proteins, while the ALS degrades long-lived bulk proteins, including cytosolic proteins, organelles, aggregates and extracellular proteins imported into the cell by endocytosis or pinocytosis [7, 8] . During ubiquitination, one (monoubiquitination) or more (polyubiquitination) highly conserved 76 amino acid ubiquitin (Ub) chains are covalently attached to a lysine residue of the target protein via a cascade of enzymatic reactions catalysed by ubiquitination enzyme (E1), ubiquitintransferring enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3). Firstly, Ub is activated by E1 in an ATP-dependent manner, then is transferred to form a thioester bond with E2; finally, E3 promotes the transfer of Ub from E2 to the Lys of the target protein [9] . A single Ub molecule conjugated to the Lys residue of a substrate is referred to as monoubiquitination, while polyubiquitination involves the attachment of multiple Ub chains. Subsequently, the tagged substrates are deubiquitinated by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), Ub molecules are released from substrates by enzymatic steps, and deubiquitinated substrates are degraded into small peptides by the 26S proteasome. The 26S proteasome is composed of a 20S catalytic core and two 19S regulatory caps on both ends of the 20S core [10, 11] . A simplified schematic diagram showing the steps involved in the degradation of tagged proteins is shown in Fig. 1 A.

The SARS-CoV appears to be transmitted primarily by large droplet spread, although surface contamination and possibly airborne spread may play a role. Recent data suggest that the virus may remain viable for considerable periods on a dry surface (up to 24 hours); hence, transmission through fomites may occur. The outbreak in an apartment complex in Hong Kong that accounted for more than 300 cases has been attributed to fecal spread. A patient with SARS who had diarrhea stayed with his brother in this building. It is thought that infection spread from him to other residents in the building through a leaking sewage drain, which allowed aerosolization of virus-containing material. Sewage also backed into bathroom floor drains in some apartments and may have accounted for some of the transmission. The SARS-CoV is stable in feces (and urine) at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days. The virus is more stable (up to 4 days) in stool from patients with diarrhea (which has a higher pH than normal stool). 16 It is presently unclear at what stage of the disease viral shedding occurs or whether someone who is infected but asymptomatic can infect others. As our knowledge of SARS and the etiologic coronavirus evolves, we will be able to address these important issues.

MERS-CoV affects the respiratory system and leads to respiratory failure, especially in older people, immunocompromised individuals, and those suffering from cardiopulmonary illnesses [4] . MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage of the C beta-coronaviruses first identified in bats [5] and is transmitted to humans through an intermediate animal, such as the dromedary camel [6, 7] . However, most MERS-CoV infections are spread from human to human through direct or indirect contact with infected people, for example through droplets from coughing or sneezing, from shaking hands or from touching contaminated surfaces [8] . These infections can be transmitted among close family members, in the community and in healthcare facilities from patients to healthcare providers.

Emerging and reemerging diseases are a challenge for public health worldwide and particularly for Brazil, where the existence of the Amazon region provides a constant source of new pathogens that are transmitted from wild animals to man. Viruses, such as the agents of Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and Yellow Fever, continue to infect thousands of people worldwide. Infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), represent a major threat to public health. The SARS-CoV virus was the agent of the SARS epidemic during 2002/2003 (Cui et al. 2019; Zhong et al. 2003) and just a decade later, the world witnessed another outbreak, known as "Eastern Respiratory Syndrome" (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV in the Middle East (Bawazir et al. 2018; Zaki et al. 2012) . While researchers still continue to investigate the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity and develop effective therapeutic strategies against MERS, the world is now witnessing another outbreak on a global scale, COVID-19 (Wu et al. 2020) , caused by SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the Coronaviridae family, order Nidovirales. These viruses have a RNA genome in the form of singlestranded RNA with positive polarity. The RNA genome is packaged inside a helical capsid formed by the protein (N) nucleocapsid and surrounded by an envelope where at least three structural proteins exist: the membrane protein (M); the envelope protein (E), which is involved in the assembly of the virus; and the spike protein (S), which is involved in the entry of the virus into host cells. These structural proteins form spikes on the surface of the virus, giving the appearance of a crown, hence its name.

The virus "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2, earlier provisionally named "2019 novel coronavirus" (2019-nCoV)), is thought to spread from person to person through droplets and contacts when a person with the virus coughs or sneezes and by touching objects contaminated with the virus, then touching one's eyes, nose or mouth. SARS-CoV-2 causes the respiratory illness coronavirus disease 2019 . (Hereafter we solely use the acronym SARS-CoV-2, indicating either.) Main symptoms include diverse symptoms from respiratory infections, ranging from mild to severe, such as fever, malaise, cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia. In addition, phlegm, sore throat, headache, hemoptysis, nausea, and diarrhea also appear. Elderly, immunocompromised patients, and patients with underlying medical comorbidities are most likely to be in critical condition or die from the virus. Best current estimates suggest a case fatality rate (CFR) for SARS-CoV-2 of about 1-2% (Shim et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b) , much larger than the order of 0.1% for a moderate seasonal influenza. Yet, there is still much uncertainty about this number because of the often limited testing capabilities, and endogenous factors such as hospital overload (Ghaffarzadegan and Rahmandad, 2020) . Further, estimating the CFR requires information about the number infected (the denominator). Yet, this number is hard to detect, because of the large number of cases with mild and/or flu-like symptoms. For example, about 80% of people with SARS-COV-2 has mild (or no) symptoms, while 20% has severe symptoms, with about a third of those latter group becoming critically ill (ECDC, 2020).

Primary symptoms associated with CoV infection include respiratory, hepatic, enteric and neurological diseases. Previous investigation showed that there are 6 type of CoVs (hCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) which can infect the human species. HCoV-NL63, hCoV-229E belongs to alphaCoV genus while rest belongs to betaCoV genus. (Tang et al., 2015) . The betaCoVs appears to be prima-facie genre of CoVs which will peril universal human civilization in upcoming decades. Recently, the 2019-nCoV outbreak spread from China to the intercontinental arena and already infected 0.3 million people globally claiming ~13000 (~4.3%) deaths till 21 st March 2020 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). China and Italy were the epicentres until now and chances for more calamitous centres cannot be ruled out in near future. Genome sequence analysis of SARS, MERS and 2019-nCoV confirmed its presence in betaCoVs family and divergence from the other two viruses (Zhu et al., 2020) . The 2019-nCoV is a positivestrand RNA viruses with ~29 Kb genome size, 125 nm in diameter and 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs) (Song et al., 2019) . Viral genome encodes for 4 major structural proteins namely envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M) and 3-5 nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The genome starts with short untranslated regions (5' UTR) followed by genes 5′-replicase (rep gene), S, E, M, N and 3' UTR (Song et al., 2019) . Two-third of the genome is represented by the rep gene at 5' end which encodes for non-structural protein (Nsp). Spike protein is responsible for receptor binding and corresponding viral entry into the host and hence important target for future drugs to restrict the viral titre (Du et al., 2009 (Du et al., , 2017 . Viral assembly relies primarily on M and E proteins and RNA synthesis is achieved by action of N protein (Song et al., 2019) .

Once the decision, timing, and location of the surgical procedure have been decided, surgical planning starts right from when the patient is transferred from the isolation ward to the OR. Each step needs to be planned and performed methodically in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative settings to avoid inadvertent COVID-19 exposure (Fig. 2) . Surgical masks need to be worn for all nonintubated patients during the transfer process, and it is mandatory for all staff accompanying patients to be wearing full PPE including N95 masks, visors, or goggles. For intubated patients coming from the intensive care unit, a dedicated transport ventilator must be used. Staff must be mindful to clamp endotracheal tubes when changing ventilators during the transfer process to avoid aerosolization. A specific route that is the most direct and least crowded must be taken from the isolation ward to the OR. This route, including elevators, must be clearly sign-posted and cleared by security staff prior to transfer.

The global pandemic has repositioned our priorities to value the essentials of life, including food but also community and public services. The connections between people, places and the environment have become a key factor to understand how our lifestyles are sustained but also challenged: from the global impact of a virus locally transmitted from animals to humans to the importance of mutual-aid to access food. These interdependences expose the futility of individualistic approaches to address planetary health challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic is thus a dramatic call to ensure universal rights and collective responsibilities. This collective turn is clearly exemplified in the unprecedented public policies implemented across the globe, from freezing mortgage repayments to taking over private hospitals, 1 which defy the limits of what was portrayed as 'possible' in policy-making. However, this collective approach is partly hinging on essentialising equality discourses around "we are all affected, we are all the same" that largely fail to recognise the diversity of situations within society and across places (Young 1990; Fraser 2008) , and therefore limit the possibilities of delivering just and long-lasting solutions such as assuring good food for all without further depleting the planet.

In December 2019, China detected many cases of viral pneumonia-like disease similar to SARS that were confirmed to be caused by novel Betacoronavirus, provisionally called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Since then, the novel coronavirus outbreak has raised attention throughout the world. Although the potential cause of the disease is still unknown, initial reports predicted that the virus is possibly of zoonotic origin. 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for severe respiratory infection in humans termed as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) [10]. nCoV is the third known coronavirus that causes fatal respiratory diseases in humans after highly pathogenic viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Chinese researchers isolated the novel coronavirus from the infected patient in early 2020. As the virus is closely related to other bat coronaviruses, it is suspected that the bats are the primary reservoir for the virus. However, it is still unclear that, if the virus transmitted to humans directly from the bats or whether through an intermediate host. Detailed understanding of the enzootic patterns of the virus, its evolution, and surveillance are essential to control the disease and possibly to prevent the future epidemics of similar viruses.

The actual emergency in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis is successful drug repurposing, [34] for ab initio drug discovery and its lengthy phases will take 10 + years and cannot contribute to a rapid jugulation of the current outbreak -vaccine development being the rational alternative. Drug repurposing of known antivirals does (unfortunately) not require high-throughput calculations or screen-ing… because approved antivirals are preciously few. [25] Clearly, mankind allotted sufficient research resources only against threatening, widely spread and persistent viruses. Until 2020, coronaviruses did not reunite all the three conditions. For example, the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) did not vanish but has no pandemic potential as it only spreads from camel to human: it is de facto a neglected disease, which at only 70 entries in ChEMBL did not even make it into the pool of herein studied chemical spaces. If the long and costly drug discovery campaign would have been pursued at high priority, although the SARS threat disappeared and MERS is confined to remote rural regions of the world, we would have certainly been in a better situation to address SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of a larger and better suited portfolio of repurposeable antivirals. Following long-time goals, not driven by immediate danger but by the rational decision to anticipate further threats, has never been a strength of Homo sapiens -although it is the only mammal as successful in spreading over Terra as viruses and bacteria.

Covid-19 is spreading from China to other regions causing human suffering, economic disruption, and Globalization. Some people said that if their country did not get foreigners from abroad, coronavirus would never come inside their country. It is raising health concerns and the risk of wider restrictions on the movement of people, goods and services, falls in business and consumer confidence and slowing production. The Interim Outlook presents both a best-case scenario in which the extent of the coronavirus is broadly contained and a "domino" prospect of contagion that is more widespread. In both cases, it is reasonable to call governments to act immediately to limit the spread of the coronavirus, protect people and businesses from its effects and shore up demand in the economy. One possible way to protect people from unreasonable decision is using patented method of identification/authentication of citizens [11] .

T he growing threat of a pandemic caused by influenza virus variants such as the influenza A (H1N1), avian flu virus (H5N1), or virulent pathogenic agents presents a unique challenge to healthcare workers, emergency responders, and the civilian population. The influenza virus can be spread from person to person in airborne droplets produced by the sneeze or cough of an infected person. (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that healthcare workers wear a respiratory protective device at least as protective as a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved, fit-tested, N95 disposable filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) when in close contact to a patient infected by a respiratory pathogen (e.g., tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, and so on) thought to spread human to human via aerosol transmission. (2) Infectious viral aerosols are not well characterized and are poorly understood in the real world. A single virus can range in size from 20 to 300 nm. Although a single virus may be smaller than a bacteria particle (300 to 10,000 nm in size), viral aerosols likely exist as agglomerates or attached to inert particles. (3, 4) Infectious aerosols generated by coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing create a diverse size of particles ranging from less than 1 μm to 100 μm. (5) Measurements taken in a healthcare facility in the size ranges of <1 μm, 1-4 μm, and > 4 μm detected particles containing the influenza in each range at 4, 46, and 49%, respectively. (6) Although natural occurring virus aerosols likely exist as agglomerates, the infectious aerosol process is not well known and does not exclude the possibility of an infectious viral aerosol within the nanometer size range.

Although it is likely that droplet transmission is the primary route, it is possible that all the methods of transmission have not yet been identified. The following are accepted to be valid by infectious disease specialists, microbiologists, and public health authorities, after evaluation using clinical epidemiologic methodology, viral serology, electron microscopy, and genetic sequencing'l: 1. Symptomatic patients transmit the disease agent. 7 -11 ,15 The corollary is that virus carriers who are as yet asymptomatic do not spread the virus. 2. Viral spread is by droplets from the oropharynx, nasopharynx, trachea, and lungs, and from stool. JOGC 3. The incubation period is believed to not exceed 10 days.

In late December 2019, reports emerged from Wuhan, China of a novel corovonavirus SARS-CoV-2, which caused severe acute respiratory distress syndrome referred to as COVID-19. 1 This illness quickly spread to the United States. 2 As the virus spread, reports of severe perioperative complications, including fatalities, began to emerge in the literature. 3 Some of these complications occurred in patients who had no respiratory symptoms prior to their operations. In addition to the post-operative risks to the patients, the operating room was identified as a potential site of virus transmission to healthcare providers. Endotracheal intubation and laparoscopy were identified as potential aerosol generating procedures that could spread virus from the patient to healthcare providers. Additionally, shortages in personal protective equipment (PPE) were reported throughout the United States. The American College of Surgeons issued recommendations that elective operations should be minimized or cancelled altogether. 4 Traditionally, surgical removal of the appendix was considered the standard management for appendicitis. Recently, multiple studies have shown that non-operative management of acute appendicitis is a safe and effective means of treatment. 5-7 A combination of intravenous antibiotics and oral antibiotics can be used to successfully treat appendicitis.

The life-threatening pneumonia outbreak started as an epidemic within Wuhan City, China. On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported critically ill cases of viral pneumonia. Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) identified the virus as SARS-CoV-2 [26] . The Chinese government then mandated a quarantine to control the epidemic stage and to determine the effectiveness of a quarantine against the virus [27] . However, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted rapidly, quickly crossing borders of various countries. Thus, the number of established cases climbed quickly, causing the WHO to announce COVID-19 a global pandemic disease on March 11, 2020. Initially, China had the most confirmed cases, followed by North America and Europe. Italy and the US, however, surpassed China in terms of the number of established cases. Thus, at this stage of vigorous spread, it is essential to determine the mechanism of viral infection to control and treat the disease. Until now, it was believed that bat, especially Rhinolophus affinis, was the natural host of the virus [7] . It is still uncertain how this virus was transmitted from bat to human, although some research has suggested that pangolin (Manis javanica) could be the intermediate host [14, 28, 29] . The aggressive intervention steps were taken by governments, such as isolating and quarantining latent patients, have reduced the contact rate and effectively decreased the peak for COVID-19 cases.

The NSPs are essential in the replication process of Alphavirus. In addition, these NSPs also play a vital role in the infection and interaction of the virus with host cells. Out of the four NSPs, NSP1 (537 aa), whose structure is shown in Fig. 4 .2, binds with membrane proteins and activates guanylyl transferase and methyl transferase, which are involved in the covering of 26S and 42S RNAs (Ahola and Kääriäinen, 1995; Kääriäinen and Ahola, 2002; Koonin et al., 1993; Laakkonen et al., 1994) . In the response of Alphavirus capping, the methyl group is transferred by NSP1 from S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet) to GTP. Subsequently, before transferring 7-methyl-GMP (m7GMP) to virus RNA, a covalent complex is formed between m7GMP and NSP1. The response of capping of Alphavirus is somewhat different from the capping of the cellular mRNAs, where guanylyl transferase is first transmitted from GMP to RNA, followed by methylation of GMP-RNA (Ahola and Kääriäinen, 1995) . The enzymatic actions of NSP1 are necessary for virus replication. A virus becomes noninfectious by single-point mutation because this transformation abolishes the enzymatic activities (Wang et al., 1996) . NSP1 is strongly bound with the plasma membrane of infected cells, and when NSP1 is expressed alone then it functions as a single membrane anchor in virus replication complexes (Peränen et al., 1995; Salonen et al., 2003; Žusinaite et al., 2007) . Amphipathic alpha-helix is formed when amino acid 245-264 of NSP1 mediates the binding of plasma membrane (Ahola and Kääriäinen, 1995; Žusinaite et al., 2007) . The binding activities of NSP1 with the membrane can be affected by a single-point mutation and it is lethal for the virus (Žusinaite et al., 2007) . In SFV, the Cys 418-420 residues of NSP1 and in SINV, Cys420 of NSP1 tighten the membrane binding by posttranslational palmitoylation (Laakkonen et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1996; Žusinaite et al., 2007) . Palmitoylation is required only for the formation of the replication complexes or sustainability of the virus, and not for enzymatic activities of NSP1 (Ahola and Kääriäinen, 1995; Žusinaite et al., 2007) . However, removal or exchange of cysteine residues 418-420 in NSP1 of SFV significantly obstructs virus duplication and causes growth of expletive alterations (Žusinaite et al., 2007) . It has been observed from the virus expression that palmitoylation-deficient NSP1 is not capable of causing the disease in mice; these viruses induce low levels of viruses in the blood stream, but no infection has been observed in the brain tissues (Ahola and Kääriäinen, 1995) . NSP1 is responsible for the initiation of structure on the cell surface, similar to filopodia that is representative of Alphavirus-septic cells (Hardy and Strauss, 1989; Laakkonen et al., 1998; Rikkomen, 1996; Žusinaite et al., 2007) . The functional activities and significance of filopodia-like structures and palmitoylation remain unidentified.

Based on the published literature and clinical observations of COVID-19 patients, we propose reasonable hypotheses about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. The virus might pass through the mucous membranes, especially nasal and larynx mucosa, then enters the lungs through the respiratory tract. The early most common symptoms of infection are fever and cough [37] . The virus may enter the peripheral blood from the lungs, causing viremia. Then the virus would attack the targeting organs that express ACE2, such as the lungs, heart, renal, gastrointestinal tract [38, 39] . The SARS-CoV-2 detected in the fecal samples [37] is more likely because the virus enters the blood from the lungs and then travels from the blood to the intestines, which supports our hypothesis. Dawei Wang et al found that the median time from symptom onset to ARDS was about 8 days [40] . We speculate that in this way, the virus begins a second attack, causing the patient's condition to aggravate around 7-14 days after onset. During the infection process, the white blood cell count in peripheral blood in the early stage of the disease is normal or slightly low [37] , and lymphopenia is observed in patients [40] . We speculate that B lymphocyte reduction may occur early in the disease, which may affect antibody production in the patient. In severe type patients, lymphocytes were significantly reduced [40] . We speculate that lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19 might gradually decrease as the disease progress. But the mechanism of significant lymphocyte reduction in severe type patients remains unclear. Besides, the inflammatory factors associated with diseases mainly containing IL-6 [41] were significantly increased, which also contributed to the aggravation of the disease around 7-14 days after onset. Non-survivors had higher levels of neutrophils, D-Dimer, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine than the survivors [40] .

However, other animal species are also potential novel virus reservoirs; for example, Lau et al. reported that the Deltacoronavirus porcine CoV HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) can be transmitted from birds to pigs (57) . In addition, HCoV OC43 is known to originate from bovine CoV (58) . Therefore, not only bats but also other animal species should be investigated for their potential as reservoirs or sources of emerging viruses. Indeed, we found that the canine-derived A72 cell line permitted replication of type I FCoV (Fig. 3) . Although the host receptors of type I FCoV remain unclear, use of our reporter virus for FCoV infection may provide insights on viral host jumping and emergence of novel viruses.

Worldwide, COVID-19 is showing critical issues in the response of health systems, which are put to the test by this emergency. Together with the fast spread of a new pathogen, we are witnessing a relatively new phenomenon, defined as "infodemic" by the WHO (WHO, 2020). An "infodemic" represents the uncontrolled spread of false or "exaggerated" information (i.e. misinformation) relating to the pathogen or epidemic, which might determine an unpredictable response by the population. This response can translate into an increase in the concern of the population towards the epidemics, and even outright panic. This can also lead to public unrest or other consequences that can be difficult to control. Misinformation, like a virus itself, can be easily transmitted from person to person. The WHO has therefore highlighted that the spread of unconfirmed or incorrect information can be very dangerous for public health 1 .

Response of Frederick M. Burkle, Jr., MD First, we need to change the medical and public health curriculum globally to include zoonotic diseases, or those that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Currently, this has not been a priority in education and health delivery. Medical efforts must not be directed at response phase alone, but across the entire disaster cycle: prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, and rehabilitation. Health must take ownership. This applies to all health populations, as well as being supported by the societies and the governments they live in! The WHO and its International Health Regulation Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, SARS, H1N1, MERS, HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors which the WHO is totally dependent on for their existence, and which has become most painfully evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The WHO must exist solely as a treaty-based organization sanctioned and totally funded by the United Nations and all its members. It cannot be dependent on outside financial assistance to do its work.

The influence of COVID-19 has already exceeded that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Its spread is rapid and extremely unbalanced, spanning four orders of magnitude in the number of infections in different cities. Classical epidemiological modeling is absolutely important [1] , however, the spread of COVID-19 influenced by several factors such models do not necessarily consider, such as travel from Wuhan to other cities for the Spring Festival, airborne transmission without contact, and government blockade policies. These influences make it quite difficult to predict the spread of COVID-19 because a single chance event can result in significant consequences.

The spatiotemporal association between the spread of the epidemic and human movements indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. This approach has made it possible to assess the start date of the third-generation spreads of COVID-19 epidemic and the interactions between first-generation and second-generation spreads across various regions all over the country. The proposed technique incorporating location-based service data of mobile devices can help identify the spatiotemporal generations at the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. It can be easily implemented and extended to the early exploratory study of other epidemics similar to COVID-19. The results indicate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the epidemic spread associated to human movements from epidemic sources and the potential spatiotemporal risks at the early stage of the outbreak. Control measures varying by location and time could be executed in different levels for various regions. For instance, cities with obvious third-generation spread require the strictest controls on both the exportations and the inside quarantine, cities should pay more attention to the importations and the inside quarantine if the first-generation and second-generation spreads have the strong interactive enhancements, and other cities require to focus on the control of the importations.

For a large number of health care providers world-wide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is their first experience in population-based care. In past decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, a return of the WHO’s singular global authority, and support highly coordinated population-based management. As Osler recognized, his concept of “one medicine, one health” defines what global public health is today.

Resumen Introducción: Las infecciones virales respiratorias son causa de importante morbimortalidad en recién nacidos prematuros. Hemos realizado un estudio prospectivo en nuestra unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales (UCIN) para determinar la incidencia de infecciones respiratorias, su impacto, epidemiología y pronóstico en neonatos de alto riesgo. Pacientes y métodos: Estudio prospectivo realizado entre septiembre del 2011 y mayo del 2013 entre todos los recién nacidos < 32 semanas de edad gestacional y aquellos niños cuya patología pudiera dar lugar a pensar en un ingreso superior a las 2 semanas. Se recogieron aspirados nasofaríngeos (ANF) el primer día de vida y semanalmente hasta el alta para estudio virológico mediante reacción en cadena de polimerasa. En los casos en los que los niños presentaban síntomas respiratorios, se procedió a recoger un nuevo ANF. El pediatra cumplimentó un cuestionario con los datos clínicos. Resultados: Se estudió a 60 niños; 30 (50%) de ellos con una edad gestacional <32 semanas y 36 (60%) con un peso <1.500 g. Se recogió un total de 256 ANF, 24 de los cuales resultaron positivos (9,3%). Estas 24 muestras positivas correspondieron solo a 13 niños (21,6% de los pacientes). De ellos, 9 resultaron sintomáticos y presentaron 11 episodios de infección (2 pacientes experimentaron 2 episodios diferentes con control negativo entre ellos). El virus más frecuentemente Introduction Viral respiratory infections are transmitted from person to person. Many of the viruses that cause them are carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx 1 and symptoms may not show until several days later. Although these diseases are mild in most cases, newborns, and especially those born preterm or with low birth weight, are at high risk of respiratory tract infection with severe symptoms such as respiratory distress, apnoea or haemodynamic instability. These symptoms often cannot be distinguished from symptoms caused by bacterial infections or other diseases associated to prematurity, such as enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis or apnoea of prematurity, so respiratory viruses are not the only causative agents under consideration. Yet, we know that common viral respiratory tract infections, such as infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cause considerable morbidity and mortality in preterm patients as well as severe disease outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). 2, 3 In addition to classical viruses like RSV and influenza viruses, rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus (CoV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) play an increasingly important role in respiratory tract infections in infants. Very little is known about their role in neonatal units, 4 ,5 although we have demonstrated that they are associated with relevant pathology in our unit. 6, 7 Neonatal units devote considerable effort to set up measures to prevent infection, such as the use of hygiene measures of proved effectiveness by any staff that comes in contact with the infants: applying alcohol gel before and after manipulating the child, wearing gloves, frequent handwashing, prevention of catheter-related sepsis by monitoring the catheter and withdrawing it as early as possible, and the prudent use of antibiotics.

The long-term monitoring of cardiovascular signs requires a wearable and connected electrocardiogram (ECG) healthcare device. It increases user’s comfort and diagnosis quality of chronic cardiac and/or high-risk patients. This paper covers the enormous data to be transmitted from the ECG device to the physician’s, namely the cardiologist’s, control unit. Existent ECG devices uniformly sample analog signals and convert them to digital samples which are compressed before data transmission. However, event-driven sampling simultaneously compresses and samples. Therefore, this paper quantitatively compares successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR ADC) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) compression and level-crossing analog-to-digital converter (LC-ADC). Evaluation metrics are the percent root-mean-square difference ([Formula: see text] ), bit compression ratio ([Formula: see text] ) and data length in bits. When a 12-bit reconstruction is operated on the outputs of an 8-bit LC-ADC with 12-bit and 10-kHz reference counter, the [Formula: see text] is equal to 80% for 75% of test ECG signals. That is better than the 71.87% [Formula: see text] of the 12-bit 1-kHz SAR ADC with DWT compression. The modeled LC-ADC guarantees a signal quality in terms of [Formula: see text] comparable to the [Formula: see text] of the SAR ADC with DWT compression. The data length in bits of the LC-ADC is lower than the data length in bits of the SAR ADC with more than 14-bit resolution with DWT compression for 82% of the test ECG signals. However, for lower resolutions, to obtain lower power consumption for radiofrequency transmission, a better alternative remains the SAR ADC with DWT compression.

Perhaps the most important insight made over the past several years is that coronaviruses have and will likely continue to cross between species and cause Figure 5 | cross-species transmission of coronaviruses. a | Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like bat coronavirus (BtCoV) spread and adapted to wild animals such as the Himalayan palm civet that was sold as food in Chinese wet markets. The virus frequently spread to animal handlers in these markets, but caused minimal or no disease. Further adaptation resulted in strains that replicated efficiently in the human host, caused disease and could spread from person to person. b | Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are closely related and it is thought that the virus originated in one species and then crossed species. BCoV has also spread to numerous other animals, such as alpaca and wild ruminants. c | Feline coronavirus I (FCoV-I) and canine coronavirus I (CCoV-I) are thought to share a common ancestor. CCoV-I underwent recombination with an unknown coronavirus to give rise to canine coronavirus II (CCoV-II). CCoV-II in turn underwent recombination with FCoV-I (in an unknown host) to give rise to feline coronavirus II (FCoV-II). CCoV-II probably also spread to pigs, resulting in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). One future goal will be to further delineate how the virus evades the immune response and better understand its interaction with the T and B cell responses, both in the original host (bats), in which disease appears to be mild, and in humans and experimentally infected animals. Figure 6 | inefficient activation of the type 1 interferon response, and immunopathological disease, in coronavirus infections. a | Coronaviruses, as exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), induce a type 1 interferon (IFN) response in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and macrophages, via TLR7-and MDA5-dependent pathways, respectively. b | IFNα and/or IFNβ is not produced in either SARS-CoV fibroblasts or DCs, partly because coronavirus macromolecules appear to be invisible to immune sensors. Additionally, coronaviruses encode proteins that actively inhibit IFNα and/or IFNβ expression (such as nucleocapsid (N) protein, nsp3, ORF6 and ORF3b) or signalling through the type 1 IFN receptor (such as N, nsp1, ORF6 and ORF3b). c | Consequently, the kinetics of virus clearance is delayed, with subsequent robust T and B cell and cytokine and/or chemokine responses. d | This pro-inflammatory response results in immunopathological disease that occurs during the process of virus clearance. In MHV-infected mice, virus clearance involves recruitment of activated macrophages and microglia to sites of virus infection, leading to demyelination. Similar mechanisms with exuberant cytokine production may function in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected humans, leading to severe pulmonary disease (adult respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS).

The South Korean MERS outbreak comprised 3 disease generations, with the index patient representing generation 0. Estimates of the reproduction number according to disease generation can be derived by averaging the number of secondary cases in each generation [18] . The average reproduction number followed a declining trend, from 30 cases in the first generation to 3.8 in the second generation and 0.1 in the third generation (Supplementary Figure 1) . Overall, this outbreak followed a similar trajectory to previous hospital clusters involving coronaviruses [18] , with early super-spreading events generating a disproportionate number of secondary infections, followed by a rapid decline of the reproduction number to <1.0 in subsequent generations as infection control measures gained strength. Table 1 ). In March 2014, the index patient traveled from his village to Conakry to be treated after visiting and infecting a physician. He stayed with family, 4 members of which became ill, and died in the hospital. His body was taken back to the village for a traditional burial, where 3 uncles washed his body and soon became sick. B, Cluster 22 (Supplementary Table 1 ). During June-September 2014, after the hospital from cluster 5 closed, a Monrovian patient resorted to receiving care from her church caretaker, who then went to a clinic and infected a guard, whom a healthcare worker and father treated. The guard then infected his son, whose mother denied that it was Ebola. This led to the rest of the family becoming infected. C, Cluster 47 (Supplementary Table 1 ). In October and November 2014, an imam developed symptoms in Guinea and then visited a family in Bamako, Mali. He went to a clinic and died there, infecting a nurse, physician, and all members of the family he stayed with. His body was returned to Guinea, where at least 1 infection occurred from his large traditional funeral. D, Cluster 62 (Supplementary Table 1 ). From December 2014 to February 2015, all of the cases in Liberia stemmed from one woman, who infected family members, a neighbor, and an herbalist she went to for treatment. During the third generation of secondary cases, contact tracing efforts helped stop further spreading. outbreak in West Africa. In contrast to the MERS outbreak previously described, scarce epidemiological data were available throughout the Ebola outbreak from traditional surveillance systems. To alleviate the need for solid epidemiological information and assess Ebola transmission characteristics, we designed an approach to systematically collect information on Ebola case clusters from Internet news reports published during the outbreak [19] . Below we extend and update this work and reflect on future developments needed to generalize Internetbased approaches to study transmission dynamics more broadly.

From January 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread fast from China, mainly to Southwest Asia and Europe, especially to Italy, and it is now found everywhere around the world. The disease is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the seventh member of the coronavirus family which infects humans and to which Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV also belong [55] . The classical clinical picture of COVID-19 is that of a flu-like syndrome of mild severity in most cases, but in 15% of cases it is complicated by interstitial pneumonia and a variable degree of respiratory failure [40] . The underlying pathological changes, responsible for the respiratory failure, have been characterised in two patients who underwent lung lobotomies for lung adenocarcinoma and were retrospectively found to be COVID-19 positive [6, 48] . Among COVID-19-positive patients, there are those that consult the doctor for heart symptoms, such as palpitations or chest pain rather than respiratory problems [53] . Little is known about a possible relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. An early report on 99 patients hospitalised from 1st to 20th January 2020 at Jinyntan Hospital, Wuhan, China, for SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, shows that pre-existing cardiovascular disease was present in 40% of them [7] . A second report from the same period of time on 138 patients hospitalised at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University shows that 26% of the patients required cardiologic intensive care. Among these patients, 16 .7% developed arrhythmias and 7.2% experienced an acute coronary syndrome in addition to other complications [51] . Furthermore, patients diagnosed with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels, suggesting myocardial injury [23] . Other published and anecdotal reports indicate the presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. It is not clear whether these cardiac conditions are provoked by SARS-CoV-2 or are complications typical of any other pathology with higher cardio-metabolic demand, and thus unrelated to the viral infection. Epidemiological studies conducted during the flu epidemic in USA in 1990 show that influenza and its related complications, such as secondary pneumonia, may cause myocardial infarction due to inflammation-induced destabilisation of coronary artery plaques [10] . This results from multiple mechanisms, such as tachycardia, hypoxia, increased wall stress, and thrombophilia or release of inflammatory cytokines [11] . So, a possible causal link cannot be excluded.

Furthermore, patients diagnosed with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed an increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels, suggesting myocardial injury [23] . Other published and anecdotal reports indicate the presence of myocarditis, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. It is not clear whether these cardiac conditions are provoked by SARS-CoV-2 or are complications typical of any other pathology with higher cardio-metabolic demand, and thus unrelated to the viral infection. Epidemiological studies conducted during the flu epidemic in USA in 1990 show that influenza and its related complications, such as secondary pneumonia, may cause myocardial infarction due to inflammation-induced destabilisation of coronary artery plaques [10] . This results from multiple mechanisms, such as tachycardia, hypoxia, increased wall stress, and thrombophilia or release of inflammatory cytokines [11] . So, a possible causal link cannot be excluded.

HCoV capacity to reach CNS after the nasal infection has been described previously in mice, particularly for HCoV-OC43 (St-Jean et al., 2004) . St-Jean et al. (2004) reported that upon infection, viral antigens are detected in the olfactory bulb 3 days later, with no presence of virus in perivascular blood cells or any other part of the brain. After 7 days, the virus is detected throughout the whole brain tissue, indicating that it can rapidly propagate once set in CNS. This replication leads to a rapid death by acute encephalitis of infected mice. Remarkably, ablation of the olfactory bulb prevented the spread of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), upon nasal infection (Perlman et al., 1990) . Therefore, HCoV exhibits an intrinsic capability to infect neural cells and spread from CNS to the periphery via a transneural route, as has also been seen for MHV (Perlman et al., 1990; Barthold et al., 1990 ; Figure 3) .

Moreover, similar to the symptoms of influenza, the most common symptoms for patients confirmed with COVID-19 are fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue, some have a headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea [29] . So, most people searched the term "coronavirus symptoms" on Google, afraid of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the most relative searched terms in the USA, the UK, Canada, and New Zealand were "coronavirus new york", "coronavirus uk", "coronavirus canada" and "new zealand coronavirus", respectively, which may due to that people cared more about the epidemic of the COVID-19 in their own countries. Besides, people from Canada also had a great interest in the term regarding "lunar new year". Since it has been discovered that COVID-19 can transmit from human to human [30] , the Spring Festival travel rush during Chinese New Year can lead to further spread of this newly coronavirus. Thus, people in these countries might be worried that more people will be infected after the Spring Festival. Besides, the COVID-19 outbreak and spread speedily during the Spring Festival, which may also associate with our results.

VSV-Gpseudotyped GeCKOv2 lentiviruses were generated at the University of Michigan vector core. Each packaged GeCKOv2 A or B lentiviral half-library was used to transduce 16 million Huh7.5.1 cells as a MOI of 0.3 in 10-cm dishes 29 . After transduction, the cells were selected for 6 days with 2 µg/mL puromycin, then frozen and transferred to CDC. Following revival of each half-library, 10 7 transduced cells were infected with wild-type EBOV (Mayinga strain) at an MOI of 0.3. Three days post infection, the cells were passaged at a 1:5 ratio. Surviving cells were expanded, and lysed in TriPure (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), to inactivate EBOV present in the sample. The lysates were then transferred from BSL-4 containment to a BSL-2 laboratory and genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the TriPure method. The sgRNA sequences were amplified in two sequential PCR reactions, both using Herculase II enzyme (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). For the first reaction, for gDNA from EBOV-selected cells and from input library cells, 13 replicate 100 µL reactions were set up, each with 10 µg of extracted gDNA, and products were amplified over 18 cycles using primers PCR#1-forward and -reverse (listed in Supplementary Virus assays. For assays to measure EBOV-induced CPE, HAP1 cells were seeded at 5000 cells per well of a 96-well plate. The next day, cells were infected with wildtype EBOV (strain Mayinga) at an MOI of 0.3. Three days post-infection (p.i.), cells were trypsinized and passed at 1:10 ratio into an opaque white 96-well plate. Six days p.i. cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, USA). For time-courses using the fluorescent reporter viruses, EBOV-ZsG, LASV-ZsG, and RVFV-GFP, HAP1 cells were seeded at 5000 cells, or fibroblasts at 3000 cells, per well of an opaque 96-well plate.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, causing a serious coronavirus disease called COVID-19 [1] . Initially believed to have originated in animals, it was later shown to be able to spread from person to person [2, 3] . On January 21, 2020, the COVID-19 was classified into a category B infectious disease of high priority requiring countrywide management measures (category A management measures) in China. On January 30, WHO declared that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of March 26, 2020, there have been 552,943 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in 200 countries and regions, including 399,192 active cases, 25,045 deaths, and 128,706 cases recovered. On March 2, the European CDC raised the SARS-CoV-2 risk level from moderate to high. Almost the entire globe is now designated by the US CDC as under a class 3 travel advisory. On March 11, 2020 , the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Global travel has been severely restricted and mass quarantine measures have been implemented in almost every country.

In mid-January 2020, studies of clusters of infected family members and medical workers confirmed person-to-person transmission [2, 3, 22] . Close contact with symptomatic individuals constitutes the major risk for extensive transmission. Ongoing spread may rely on unknown transmission by asymptomatic hosts [20] . Guan et al. reported that of the 3.5% of infected patients who were identified as healthcare workers, 1.9%, 31.3%, and 72.3% of patients had a history of contact with wildlife, recent traveled to Wuhan, and contact with people from Wuhan, respectively [4] . a) Respiratory droplets-SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets [2, 4, 7, 20] . When a patient coughs or sneezes, aerial droplets containing virus may be inhaled by susceptible individuals. b) Direct contact-Guan et al. found that 71.8% of non-local residents developed COVID-19 due to contact with individuals from Wuhan [4] . More than 1800 of 2055 (C 88%) medical workers with COVID-19 were in Hubei, according to reports from 475 hospitals [20] . c) Indirect contact-this occurs when droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 land on the surface of tabletops, doorknobs, telephones, and other inanimate objects. The virus is transferred from the surface to the mucous membranes by contaminated fingers touching the mouth, nose, or eyes [23] . Studies have estimated that SARS-CoV-2 can exist for up to 5 days at a temperature of 20°C and a humidity of 40-50% and can survive for less than 48 h in dry air, with a reduction in viability after 2 h [24] . d) Asymptomatic transmission-asymptomatic infections have been reported in at least two cases with exposure history to a potentially pre-symptomatic patient who was later diagnosed with COVID-19. The virus was then transmitted to another three healthy family members [25, 26] . Prior to the development of symptoms, individuals may not be isolated and may constitute an important mobile viral source. This transmission contributes to the difficulties in containing the spread of the disease [27, 28] . e) Interfamilial transmission-transmission within family clusters is very common. One study reported that 78 to 85% of cases in large aggregate groups occurred due to interfamilial transmission in Sichuan and Guangdong, China [20] . f) Aerosol transmission-in a closed environment with poor ventilation, aerosols may remain airborne for 24-48 h and spread from several meters to dozens of meters [7, 29, 30 ]. However, there has been no strong evidence for aerosol transmission. The WHO also deemed that this route requires further investigation [31, 32] . g) Ocular transmission-it has been reported that a doctor without eye protection was infected during an inspection in Wuhan on January 22, 2020 [33] . Further studies found that SARS-CoV-2 may be detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of COVID-9 patients [34, 35] . h) Fecal-oral transmission-this was first reported in a COVID-19 case in the USA [21] . Subsequent studies detected SARS-CoV-2 in the feces and anal swabs of COVID-19 patients [4, 36] . Furthermore, 23.3% of COVID-19 patients remained SARS-CoV-2 positive in feces even when the viral RNA was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia [37] .

Since December 2019, a cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease now named as 2019 novel coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and spread rapidly from China to other countries[1] [2] [3] . Cardiac injury and arrhythmias were common, especially for ICU patients [1] [4] . Short-term prognosis of COVID-19 patients are discrepancy and in-hospital mortality risk are high in severe cases[1] [2] Although previous study had indicated that several risk factors were independently associated with short-term mortality, such as elevated d-dimer, older age and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [2] , few studies focused on cardiac injury with COVID-19 patients. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) was highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial damage [5] and hs-cTnI elevation was not uncommon with COVID-19 patients[1] [2] . However, a recent report of autopsy for a COVID-19 patient found that there were a few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, but no other substantial damage in the heart tissue [6] . Until now, the relationship between cardiac injury and in-hosptial prognosis and the mechanism of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients remained controversial. Studies focused on cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients were scarce. In the present study, we sought to investigate the association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19.

Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) that can cause severe infections, like skin and soft tissue infections, sepsis and potentially fatal endocarditis, similar to diseases caused by S. aureus. In contrast to S. aureus, only very few virulence associated proteins have been described. A fibrinogen binding protein and von Willebrand binding adhesin, and synergistic hemolysins have been discussed as putative pathogenicity factors in S. lugdunensis. In this study we designed primer for the detection of two annotated putative fibrinogen binding adhesins and three annotated hemolysins in a collection of more than 100 different Staphylococcus lugdunensis strains, to detect the occurrence of these genes. The prevalence of these fibrinogen binding protein and hemolysin genes were compared with their phenotypic correlates. All strains were tested for their binding to fibrinogen and also on Columbia blood agar plates for hemolysis. Except for the SLUSH gene cluster all the other alleged hemolysins and adhesins had a very high prevalence. SLGD_00847 (slu_hemolysinIII) had a prevalence of 97 % and SLGD_00006 (slu_hemolysin) of 95 %. The SLUSH gene cluster was only found in 45 %. This indicates that the SLUSH gene cluster was absent or the gene cluster was different in these strains. After 48 h of incubation 93.1 % of the S. lugdunensis strains showed hemolysis and 12 of them even had a strong hemolysis. As already shown in a previously report, hemolysis after 48 h is typical for S. lugdunensis. The high occurrence of the hemolysin genes also indicate that the hemolysis attribute is less likely determined by a single hemolysin gene but rather a supposed combined effect of several hemolysin genes or differences in their expression. (Sinha et al., 1999) . In polarized cells 5 1 integrins are primarily located to the basolateral side, only a minor fraction is localized to the apical membrane. We hypothesize that initial binding of FnBPs to apically located receptors increases the permeability of the endothelial barrier and thus facilitates access to the basolateral pool of 5 1 integrins. Methods: Human endothelial cells (EA.hy 926) were infected with different wild type and specific mutant / complemented staphylococcal strains on transwell filters. Permeability was measured by transendothelial flux of FITC-dextran at different time points. Inhibition experiments were performed with Src family protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and PP2. PP3, an EGFR inhibitor, served as a control for specificity. Effects mediated by cytotoxicity were quantified by several viability tests. Changes in impedance which reflect changes in cell morphology of the endothelial layer have been determined by real-time impedance analysis. Results: Infection with wild type S. aureus and S. carnosus heterologously expressing FnBPs, but not Clumping factor A (Clf A), induced an increase in permeability compared to non-infected cells. By contrast, the nonpathogenic S. carnosus wild type had an opposite effect. An FnBP double knock out mutant of wild type S. aureus failed to increase permeability. Genistein and PP2 reduced loss of integrity by roughly 50%, whereas PP3 had no protective effect. FnBP expression per se did not lead to substantial cell death, as determined by cell mass (crystal violet staining), mitochondrial respiratory activity (WST-1 conversion) and hypo-diploid DNA (modified cell cycle analysis). Real-time impedance analysis yielded similar results as permeability data demonstrating that impedance declines upon infection with FnBP-expressing strains. Discussion: Our data show that FnBPs are required for an increase in permeability of the endothelial cell layer. Src family kinases are crucial components of the integrin signaling pathways. Partial protection by genistein and PP2 suggests that Src family kinases mediate an increased permeability of endothelial cells, supposedly by affecting tight junction proteins. This effect might be mediated by phosphorylation of either tight junction or regulatory proteins. Further studies will include scanning electron microscopy to determine changes in cell morphology, immunodetection and localization of tight junction proteins and siRNA transfection to knock down Src family kinases. Streptococcus pneumoniae cell surface proteins play a central role during the infection process and are considered to be important virulence factors of the pathogen. They are thought to be implicated in colonization, bacterial adhesion to and invasion into host cells, and immune evasion mechanisms as well. Different clusters of proteins such as LPxTG cell wall-anchored proteins, choline-binding proteins, and lipoproteins decorate the pneumococcal cell surface. Among them lipoproteins represent the largest group. They are anchored to the membrane via a lipid moiety which is covalently attached by the diacylglyceryl transferase Lgt. The signal peptide is cut off by the lipoprotein-specific signal peptidase Lsp. A global analysis of pneumococcal surface-associated and extracellular proteins was performed using a combination of biotinylation and GeLC-MS/MS. To study the fate of lipoproteins in pneumococci the surface-and exoproteome of non-encapsulated D39 cps was compared to the protein profiles of isogenic lgt, lsp, and lgt lsp mutants, which are deficient in lipoprotein maturation. Based on the genome data 37 lipoproteins, 16 LPxTG-anchored proteins, and 12 choline-binding proteins were predicted for strain D39. Out of them 33, 12, and 2, respectively, were identified. The abundance of lipoproteins found to be surface-associated is significantly decreased in the lgt mutant. Accordingly, their abundance in the exoproteome is considerably increased. In contrast, the amount of surfaceexposed lipoproteins in the lsp mutant was unaffected for the majority of identified lipoproteins. Only a few lipoproteins are less abundant, however, the corresponding exoproteome of the lsp mutant showed no significant changes. The double knockout lgt lsp showed for the majority of lipoproteins similar amounts on the surface, while only a minority is less abundant. Remarkably, the amount of lipoproteins in the exoproteome is significantly increased for D39 cps lgt lsp. Streptococcus agalactiae colonizes the urogenital tract of 10-30% of healthy women. During delivery it can be transmitted from the mother to the newborn and cause sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis. Adhesion to extracellular matrix protein is an important pathogenicity mechanism of gram positive bacteria. The laminin receptor on brain endothelial cells has recently been shown to be crucial for the initiation of contact between meningeal pathogens and the blood brain barrier. In S. agalactiae the surface protein Lmb mediates the attachment to human placental laminin and is located on a pathogenicity islet that is absent in many bovine S. agalactiae isolates. The crystal structure of Lmb was recently solved and shows that it belongs to the cluster 9 family of ABC (ATP binding cassette) transport system. The structural organization of Lmb closely resembles ABC type solute binding proteins (SBPs) in which two structurally related globular domains interact with each other to form a metal binding cavity at the interface. The bound zinc in Lmb is tetrahedrally coordinated to residues H66, H142, H206 and E281 from both the domains. A highly disordered loop spanning residues 123-138 has been observed and it has been shown to play a role in metal uptake and release of the protein in homologous structures. To analyze the role of individual amino acid residues for the binding properties of Lmb to immobilized laminin targeted mutations of the Zn binding motif were introduced into an lmb vector construct that allows the expression of lmb as a histidine fusion protein.

Coronaviruses are the largest RNA viruses identified to date. These have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 27 − 30 kb in length that typically contains four structural proteins, namely the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Coronaviruses also encode several nonstructural proteins by subgenomic mRNAs and two large polyproteins by mRNA 1. The two polyproteins are processed by viral proteinases to generate more than 10 mature cleavage products [13] . Coronaviruses cause a wide spectrum of diseases in humans and animals but primarily infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosa [14] . Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a recently discovered coronavirus that causes severe and acute diarrhea and rapid weight loss in piglets less than six days old. From January to May 2017, the outbreak of SADS-CoV led to the death of almost 25,000 piglets in southern China and resulted in significant economic losses [15] . After adaptation to a cell culture system (e.g. Vero E6), SADS-CoV undergoes a cytolytic life cycle. A hallmark of SADS-CoV infection of cultured cells is the formation of syncytial cells, which rapidly spread from virusinfected cells to the surrounding cells. The syncytia are subsequently destroyed, and the cells round up and detach from the substratum, concomitant with the release of virions. However, the nature of the events leading to cell death in SADS-CoV-infected cells remains largely unknown.

Rotaviruses (RV) affect young ones of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, and poultry, including humans. It is one of the major concerns of neonatal diarrhea in domestic animals and mostly caused by group A RV (total 9 group AÀI). Bovine rotavirus (BRV) affects calves of 2À8 weeks of age and its susceptibility decreases as age progresses. Clinical manifestation in each species is similar ranging from asymptomatic subclinical condition to severe enteritis. Clinically calves suffer from acute, watery, dehydrating diarrhea and may succumb to infection. The morbidity and mortality are very high, leading to huge economical losses in dairy and beef industries worldwide. Mucosal immunity plays a major role to inhibit intestinal infections by any infectious pathogen and it is transferred from the dam to new young ones via colostrum feeding. Therefore if the pregnant dam is immunized with a rotavirus vaccine sufficiently, she can transfer antirotavirus maternal antibodies in surplus to protect calves sufficiently long duration. Both conventional and new generation vaccine such as subunit, DNA vaccine, VLP, plant-based edible vaccine (used VP-4, VP-6, or capsid protein), reverse geneticbased vaccine and recombinant BCG expressing VP-6 gene were evaluated to generate protective immunity (Poelaert et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2012) . Commercially attenuated strains of BRV and coronavirus (Galf Guard, Zoetis, USA, PBS animal health, United States) are used to immunize calves and adult cattle. Inactivated BRV (serotypes G6 and G10) and coronavirus propagated on established cell lines and a K99 E. coli bacterin formulated with adjuvant (scourGuard, Zoetis, USA, MSD animal health) are used to immunize pregnant cattle and heifers. Further, some vaccines have Clostridium perfringens type C and type D toxoid, E. coli K99 along with inactivated bovine coronavirus type 1 and 3, inactivated BRV type G6 and G10 (Cooper).

We found that mortality rates were higher among the elderly group for both genders which was also concordant with a previous study [26] . The possible explanation for the enhanced mortality in aged patients could be the presence of senescence-associated immune vulnerability in these individuals and suboptimal immune reactivity following a systemic challenge by exposure to MERS-CoV natural infection. Other Gulf countries show a few sporadic cases which may be due to the missing data that still have to be set straight or it could possibly be due to small size of camel populations is wide spread across vast geographical region. There may be still other factors involved that remain hidden at present but contribute significantly to the survival, transmission and pathogenesis of this relatively newly identified pathogen in this region of the world. Notably, it appears as if coronaviruses are able to cause serious viral infections when transferred from their reservoir (wild bat) host to the human host as observed previously for Ebola virus as well which was transmitted from wild bats to humans in Africa. Actually, many of MERS-CoV cases are initiated in rural areas and following hospitalization, further cases were reported. The majority of the MERS-CoV outbreak cases took place at health facilities; index cases are very crucial and they raise the question of the route of transmission of this zoonotic virus. This warrants caution that strict healthcare protocols and guidelines need to be followed and practiced by health care personnel in order to prevent the new outbreaks of MERS-CoV.

This paper investigates whether the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic could have been favored by specific weather conditions and other factors. It is found that the 2020 winter weather in the region of Wuhan (Hubei, Central China)-where the virus first broke out in December and spread widely from January to February 2020-was strikingly similar to that of the Northern Italian provinces of Milan, Brescia and Bergamo, where the pandemic broke out from February to March. The statistical analysis was extended to cover the United States of America, which overtook Italy and China as the country with the highest number of confirmed COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) cases, and then to the entire world. The found correlation patterns suggest that the COVID-19 lethality significantly worsens (4 times on average) under weather temperatures between 4 &#8728; C and 12 &#8728; C and relative humidity between 60% and 80%. Possible co-factors such as median population age and air pollution were also investigated suggesting an important influence of the former but not of the latter, at least, on a synoptic scale. Based on these results, specific isotherm world maps were generated to locate, month by month, the world regions that share similar temperature ranges. From February to March, the 4-12 &#8728; C isotherm zone extended mostly from Central China toward Iran, Turkey, West-Mediterranean Europe (Italy, Spain and France) up to the United State of America, optimally coinciding with the geographic regions most affected by the pandemic from February to March. It is predicted that in the spring, as the weather gets warm, the pandemic will likely worsen in northern regions (United Kingdom, Germany, East Europe, Russia and North America) while the situation will likely improve in the southern regions (Italy and Spain). However, in autumn, the pandemic could come back and affect the same regions again. The Tropical Zone and the entire Southern Hemisphere, but in restricted colder southern regions, could avoid a strong pandemic because of the sufficiently warm weather during the entire year and because of the lower median age of their population.

The current corona-virus outbreak is an ongoing global outbreak of corona-virus disease. The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China in 31-st of December 2019, and has since been declared as Public Health Emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization [1, 2]. As of 9-th March 2020, over 114000 cases have been confirmed in the entire world [4] . More than 110 countries, with major outbreaks in central China, Italy, South Korea and Iran [3] . More than 4000 people have died, among those more than 3100 in China and around 900 in other countries [3] . As of now no vaccine or specific anti-viral treatment is available, though research is going on. Efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include maintaining distance from other people (particularly those who are sick) [7, 8] as it is understood that this virus spreads between people via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing [6] . Therefore research on corona virus has become an urgent topic with practical significance. In this paper we look at the theoretical aspect of this problem. As very less information is available on corona virus even today, in the following we assume spreading of corona virus can happen from one to another only, if someone without enough protection comes close contact to a person carrying the corona virus. Therefore this virus spreads on a large scale within a short time through chains of such events. Using this model we estimate the spread and possible cessation of corona virus transmission. As the detailed mechanism of corona-virus transmission is not known yet, therefore this is the only model possible. In our model, people are divided into three classes: ignorant (those not aware of this virus -there number should be large at the initial stage) and let x(t) be the number of such people at time t, spreaders (those who have this virus and are spreading it -this number should be small at the initial stage) and let y(t) be the number of such people at time t) and stiflers (those who have this virus but are not spreading it -they are isolated or under medication or dead -this number should be smallest at the initial stage) and let z(t) be the number of such people at time t. All these three sub-classes of people together are called 'corona virus' class and we expect this class to expand in time and we assume all these additional people belongs to 'ignorant' sub-class. There will be another class of individuals who will not be an explicit part of our model are those who will never meet spreader or even if they meet spreader nothing will happen to them (know how to protect themselves or are lucky not to meet any spreader or are genetically protected!). Similar models are already available in literature in the context of rumour transmission [9, 10] . In our model, spreader-ignorant contact will convert the ignorant to spreader -, corona virus will be transmitted from the spreader to the ignorant, spreader-spreader contact will do nothing and the spreader-stifler contact will stifle the spreader (stiflers are placed isolated at the different locations along with doctors, therefore meeting stiflers is equivalent to meeting a doctor ¬hence when a spreader meets doctor, spreader will be isolated and called as stifler). It is important to mention here that increase in the number of stifler is equivalent to increase in number of doctors or hospitals for accommodating more stiflers, therefore spreader gets more chance to become stifler. The total population size at time t is denoted by N(t), where N(t)= x(t)+y(t)+z(t). The model is described by the following system of coupled differential equations

SIMPLE SUMMARY: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) affects the lower respiratory tract of cattle, causing high mortality. The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.

Variation in glycans within the population may play a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in viral-infection susceptibility, with the potential to inform clinical management. Glossary FUT2: the gene encoding an a(1,2)fucosyltransferase expressed in epithelial cells of multiple mucosal tissues. This enzyme catalyses the addition of L-fucose to the terminal galactose of a glycan in an a1,2 confirmation. This a(1,2)-fucosylated glycan is termed the H antigen. Glycan: a polymer of covalently linked sugar monomers. Glycosyltransferase: enzymes that catalyse the transfer of a sugar monomer from a donor to an acceptor substrate molecule, forming a glycan. A diverse range of glycosyltransferases exist, each with a particular specificity for sugar monomers and glycosidic linkage. Microbiota: all commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms sharing a defined niche. Natural antibodies (NAbs): immunoglobulins that are produced independently of T cell selection. NAbs generally have a weaker affinity, with lower specificity, compared to T cell-dependent immunoglobulins. Nonsecretor: an individual who has two loss-of-function mutations in the FUT2 gene and therefore fails to express a(1,2)-fucosylated glycans in mucosal secreted and cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. by multiple epithelial cell types. FUT2 facilitates the attachment of the L-fucose monosaccharide to specific O-linked glycan chains, producing a(1,2)-fucosylated glycans [5, 8] . This resulting a(1,2)-fucosylated glycan is a highly versatile structure and can be further modified to form one of a number of clinically important glycans, including the A and B histo-blood group antigens on mucosal surfaces [5, 8] . Mucosal histo-blood groups are analogous to those found on erythrocytes, although only those secreted by mucosal surfaces are dependent on FUT2. For example, an individual who has an A blood type will express A-type glycans on erythrocytes, but will only express A-type glycans on mucosal surfaces if they have a functional FUT2 [5] . After the glycosylation process, a(1,2)-fucosylated proteins and lipids are either secreted from mucosal epithelium into the lumen directly, or are anchored to the apical cell surface membrane. Because FUT2 controls the nature of the various a(1,2)-fucosylated glycans secreted by mucosal surfaces, it was termed the 'secretor' gene, although it does not regulate secretion per se [5] .

Two new lethal zoonotic coronaviruses of humans with epidemic potential have emerged in the past 17 years. A novel β coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus emerged in November 2002 as a lethal zoonotic human pathogen in China and rapidly spread worldwide, disappearing in 2004, never to be seen again.2 The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)3 was first identified in 2012 in a lung sample of a 60-year-old patient who had died of respiratory and multiorgan failure in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Since then, MERS-CoV has remained on the radar of global public health authorities because of recurrent nosocomial and community outbreaks, and its association with severe disease and high mortalities. From June 1 to July 31, 2015, MERS-CoV caused the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula, occurring in the Republic of Korea and resulting in 186 confirmed MERS cases with 38 deaths. This occurred when a Korean traveler returning from a trip to Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain became ill with a respiratory illness and visited several hospitals in Seoul before finally being diagnosed as having MERS-CoV infection. This outbreak clearly illustrated the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV, spreading from person to person. MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East and causes intermittent community and hospital outbreaks. As of July 2019, 2458 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases (848 deaths, 34% mortality) were reported to the WHO.

The porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is the causative agent of neurological and/or digestive disease in pigs. PHEV was one of the first swine coronaviruses identified and isolated, and the only known neurotropic virus that affects pigs. However, PHEV remains among the least studied of the swine coronaviruses because of its low clinical prevalence reported in the swine industry worldwide. PHEV can infect naïve pigs of any age, but clinical disease is age-dependent. Clinical manifestations, including vomiting and wasting and/or neurological signs, are age-related, and generally reported only in piglets under 4 weeks old. Subclinical circulation of PHEV has been reported nearly worldwide in association with a high seroprevalence in swine herds. Protection from the disease could be provided through lactogenic immunity transferred from PHEV seropositive sows to their offspring in enzootically infected herds. However, PHEV still constitutes a potential threat to herds of high-health gilts, as evidenced by different outbreaks of vomiting and wasting syndrome and encephalomyelitis reported in neonatal pigs born from naïve sows, with mortality rates reaching 100%. In absence of effective vaccine, the best practice for preventing clinical disease in suckling piglets could be ensuring that gilts and sows are PHEV seropositive prior to farrowing.

Early in the outbreak, much as with SARS, transmission via droplets and fomites began cycling between the local community and clinics and hospitals via waiting rooms crowded by both ill and healthy people (Fig. 1, arrow 2) . In this case, nosocomial spread began among both HCWs and visitors to the hospitals, who when returning home, reinfected their communities (Fig. 1, arrow 3 ). This process extended the transmission cycle in a positive feedback loop, amplifying the outbreak (Fig. 1, arrows 4 &5 ) and cascading to the point of community saturation (Fig. 1) . 4 In short, following a dynamic similar to earlier coronavirus outbreaks, COVID-19 spread from the Wuhan epicenter to nearby communities and outward within China and internationally. However, COVID-19 has some unique characteristics. These include asymptomatic infection; a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility; false negatives, and; an incubation period of up to 22 days. 10, 11 These characteristics necessitate enhancement to the TCB protocols to ensure effective transmission control. 6 Enhanced TCB (eTCB) includes two enhancements to traditional TCB. First, where TCB has a contamination zone (Isolation ward) and a transition zone, eTCB expands the transition zone to incorporate a quarantine ward as well.

Background and study aim Outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread from China to the rest of the world. Although it is primarily transmitted by contact and droplets, aerosol-generating procedures also seem to carry the possibility of airborne viral transmission. As such, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be considered a risky procedure, with several position statements recommending the adoption of safe practices in endoscopic procedures. This article aims to describe an additional tool to protect healthcare personnel during endoscopy. Methods A covering box made of acrylic plastic, named Endoprotector, was designed to cover the patient’s head, while taking into consideration movements performed by patients and healthcare staff during an endoscopic procedure. Results A cough simulation using fluorescent dye confirmed the potential benefit of the box during endoscopy, thus protecting healthcare staff from air droplets. The feasibility and practicality of the box was also tested with patients during endoscopy. Conclusion The reusable Endoprotector is easily and affordably manufactured and may reduce air droplets and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other microorganisms during endoscopy.

Since early March 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) infection has claimed 346 cases and 37 deaths in Taiwan. The epidemic occurred in two stages. The first stage caused limited familial or hospital infections and lasted from early March to mid-April. All cases had clear contact histories, primarily from Guangdong or Hong Kong. The second stage resulted in a large outbreak in a municipal hospital, and quickly spread to northern and southern Taiwan from late April to mid-June. During this stage, there were some sporadic cases with untraceable contact histories. To investigate the origin and transmission route of SARS-CoV in Taiwan's epidemic, we conducted a systematic viral lineage study by sequencing the entire viral genome from ten SARS patients. SARS-CoV viruses isolated from Taiwan were found closely related to those from Guangdong and Hong Kong. In addition, all cases from the second stage belonged to the same lineage after the municipal hospital outbreak, including the patients without an apparent contact history. Analyses of these full-length sequences showed a positive selection occurring during SARS-CoV virus evolution. The mismatch distribution indicated that SARS viral genomes did not reach equilibrium and suggested a recent introduction of the viruses into human populations. The estimated genome mutation rate was approximately 0.1 per genome, demonstrating possibly one of the lowest rates among known RNA viruses.

The noncanonical BECN1-independent autophagy pathway is stimulated by the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate. 8 The original study compared autophagy induction by oleate to that which occurs in response to the saturated fatty acid palmitate. Depletion of ATG5 and ATG7 inhibits autophagic induction by both fatty acids. However, autophagic induction by oleate does not require BECN1. As with the ATG5-and ATG7-independent pathway, treatment with BFA inhibits oleate-induced noncanonical autophagy. Note that a BECN1-independent type of autophagy was previously reported in response to mitochondrial damage, but the sensitivity to BFA was not determined. 1 As described above, a feature common to both forms of alternative autophagy is inhibition by BFA. BFA was first characterized in 1968 during a survey of antiviral activity of compounds extracted from the fungus Penicillium brefeldianum. BFA inhibits 2 different viruses, including a DNA virus, herpes simplex virus, and a RNA virus, Newcastle disease virus (similar to mumps virus). BFA was subsequently determined to inhibit a subset of GTP-exchange factors that catalyze the activation of a small GTPase called ARF1, a member of the RAS superfamily, which is responsible for the recruitment of coat proteins for vesicular trafficking between the ER and Golgi. 5 Virologists have used BFA extensively for decades because the compound can inhibit entry of some viruses and egress of others. The entry of human papillomavirus and polyomavirus is blocked by BFA treatment, whereas the number of cytoplasmic replication compartments of coronavirus is reduced by BFA. 9,10 Likewise the egress of enveloped viruses, such as herpes viruses and paramyxoviruses (Newcastle disease virus), is blocked by BFA. 4 The mechanism of the original 1968 antiviral observation has been revealed: Biosynthesis of viral glycoproteins of enveloped viruses requires their transfer from the ER to the cis-Golgi during processing of their glycans, a step inhibited by BFA, before envelopment and final egress of a mature viral particle. 11 Ebola virus, an enveloped RNA virus, also appears to fall into the latter category. 12 Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that appropriate (or hijack) cellular organelles and trafficking pathways during their infectious cycles. The numerous roles of canonical autophagy during viral infectious cycles have been reviewed. 13, 14 As is apparent from the above discussion, multiple disparate viruses require components within the region of the ER/cis-Golgi during their infectious cycle, the same region disrupted by treatment with BFA. Not only does this region overlap with the site of autophagosome formation during alternative autophagy, but this region may correspond to one of the membrane donors for canonical autophagy; for example, in vitro evidence suggests a role for the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, 15 while genetic data support the involvement of the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex 16 in the latter pathway.

SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus with high nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses detected in horseshoe bats, has spread across the world and impacted global healthcare systems and economy1,2. A suitable small animal model is needed to support vaccine and therapy development. We report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 in golden Syrian hamsters. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells, and in areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 post-inoculation (dpi), followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia on 7 dpi. Viral antigen was also found in the duodenum epithelial cells with viral RNA detected in feces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naïve hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was less efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally-infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss, and all animals recovered with the detection of neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden Syrian hamsters resemble features found in humans with mild infections.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified from a 60-year-old Saudi male patient admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on June13, 2012, with history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath who eventually expired 11 days after admission from progressive respiratory failure. 1 Sputum sample had tested negative for common respiratory viruses viz: Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza virus types1-3, Respiratory syncytial virus, and Adenovirus. Inoculation of processed sputum sample from the patient on viral cell cultures (LLC-MK2 and Vero) produced specific cytopathic effect in a Netherlands virology centre known as Erasmus Medical Center and so the identified virus was initially labelled as Human Coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center. 1 In September 2012, similar virus was recovered from a patient with severe respiratory symptoms who had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia and had been transferred from a hospital in Qatar to a hospital in London and so named as Human Coronavirus England 1. 2 This new disease was also traced to an earlier time period. In April 2012, a cluster of cases of pneumonia occurred in health care workers of an intensive care unit in a hospital in Zarqa, Jordan, of which 2 patients died, both of whom were confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus by retrospective analysis of stored sample. 3

From 2002 to 2003, a global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 5 continents and caused 8000 respiratory infections and 800 deaths. To ameliorate the effects of future outbreaks as well as to prepare for biodefense, a process for the production of a recombinant protein vaccine candidate is under development. Previously, we reported the 5 L scale expression and purification of a promising recombinant SARS vaccine candidate, RBD219-N1, the 218–amino acid residue receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS coronavirus expressed in yeast–Pichia pastoris X-33. When adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide, this protein elicited high neutralizing antibody titers and high RBD-specific antibody titers. However, the yield of RBD219-N1 (60 mg RBD219-N1 per liter of fermentation supernatant; 60 mg/L FS) still required improvement to reach our target of >100 mg/L FS. In this study, we optimized the 10 L scale production process and increased the fermentation yield 6- to 7-fold to 400 mg/ L FS with purification recovery >50%. A panel of characterization tests indicated that the process is reproducible and that the purified, tag-free RBD219-N1 protein has high purity and a well-defined structure and is therefore a suitable candidate for production under current Good Manufacturing Practice and future phase-1 clinical trials.

It is anticipated that there is probable zoonotic origin of COVID19, based on the large number of infected people who were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City where live animals are routinely sold. Efforts were made to look for a host reservoir or intermediate carriers from which the infection could spread to humans [10] . The two snake species were identified which were thought the possible COVID-19 reservoirs. However, there is no clear cut evidence for the reservoirs of coronavirus other than mammals and birds till date. The COVID-19 genomic sequence analysis showed its 88 % identity with two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses suggesting that bats are the most likely link between COVID-19 and humans [34] . Several studies have indicated that transmission from person to person is a possible way for COVID-19 infection to spread. As it was observed COVID-19 infection occurred in many people who did not even visited Wuhan's wet animal market [13] . Transmission of disease from person to person occurs mainly through direct contact or by droplets released by an infected person through coughing or sneezing. The Fig. 3 how quickly the disease has spread in each country since the 100th confirmed case. A study was conducted on COVID-19 infected women having third trimester and no evidence was analyze which can confirm that transmission can occur from mother to child. Nevertheless pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains uncertain if transmission can occur during vaginal delivery. This study is important as pregnant women's are comparatively more vulnerable to respiratory infections and extreme pneumonia [34] . The first step of COVID-19 viral infection is the binding of the receptor expressed by host cells followed by fusion with the cell membrane. The lung epithelial cells are the primary target of the virus. It has been stated that human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV occurs through binding between cellular receptor known as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and receptor-binding domain of virus spikes [34] . It is important to mention here that receptor binding domain sequence of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV. These results indicate that the most likely entry into the host cells is through the ACE2 receptor [35] .

Objective: To investigate and analysis the epidemiological characteristics of a cluster epidemic of COIVD-19 in a collective workplace in Tianjin, evduate the prevention and control measures based on limited evidence and experience in early period of COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: Descriptive research method was used to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of the cluster cases of COVID-19. Results: Since the onset of the first index case on January 15, ten confirmed COVID-19 cases had occurred in the workplace, and the epidemic had spread from the workplace to 4 families, infecting 7 family members. The median age of 17 cases was 55 (19-79) years. All the 10 employee cases were males, and in the family cases, 3 were males and 4 were females. Of the employee cases, 8 worked in CW workshop and 2 worked in administrative office building. The median exposure-onset interval of all the cases was 4 days, and the median exposure-onset interval was 4.5 days in the employee cases and 4 days in the family cases. The median onset-medical care seeking interval was 4 days in the non-isolated cases, 2.5 days in the cases with home isolation after onset, and 0.5 day in the cases with home isolation before onset. Conclusions: The clustering of COVID-19 cases was observed in this workplace in Tianjin, which affected 4 families. In the early stage of the epidemic, accurate and rapid blocking and control measures can completely prevent the large-scale spread of COVID-19.

Within the spatial logic of governing global microbial traffic, processes of transmission are of key concern. This focus displaces the medical concern for individual symptoms of disease. The individual symptom becomes only relevant in so far as it may refer to potential 'routes of transmission' (IHR, Annex 2). Whereas the symptom is a hermeneutical concept, based on the idea of interpreting signs of illness, transmission is a media concept with a postal structure that is both spatial and operative (Krämer 2008: 12-9, 138-47) . In its simplest form, transmission involves a carrier that transfers a pathogen from one point to another (Wald 2008: 71-9) . The IHR present a broad inventory of physical bodies that may act as potential carriers, covering the whole spectrum of humans, animals and inanimate matter. Disinfection, for example, is defined as the 'procedure whereby health measures are taken to control or kill infectious agents on a human or animal body surface or in or on baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods and postal parcel' (Article 1). Everything that circulates can function as a carrier of transmission: faeces, food, water are mentioned in the same manner as human remains (IHR, Articles 18.2 and 22.1). If anything, not the human, but animals feature as crucial carriers of transmission. Especially insects are seen as 'vectors' of epidemics, since they 'transport an infectious agent that constitutes a public health risk' (IHR, Article 1).

Coronavirus is an RNA virus known to be associated with respiratory disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized coronavirus whose genome sequence does not belong to any of the known coronavirus groups and which quickly spread all over the world from Asia in 2003. There has been no evidence that this infection is transmitted from blood donors to transfusion recipients, but the virus associated with SARS is present in the blood of people who are sick, and it is possible that the virus could be present in the blood immediately before a person gets sick, so that an individual with infection but no symptoms possibly could transmit SARS through a blood donation. To help determine whether or not an individual might be infected with SARS, a blood collection facility will ask a potential donor orally or in writing about any travel to a SARS-affected country or a history of SARS or possible exposure to SARS. Enzyme-linked immunoassays for detection of specific IgG and IgM antibodies and RT-PCR for detection of SARS coronavirus-specific RNA in the SARS patients have been developed. Rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of SARS and other novel coronaviruses by molecular methods will be very important in the future.

Mechanisms of viral emergence Vet. Res. (2010) 41:38 and re-emergences of human viral diseases, that have amounted to about one per year during the last decades, have been associated with RNA viruses that display active recombination or reassortment. As examples, several recent poliomyelitis outbreaks have been related to viruses generated by recombination between attenuated vaccine polioviruses and other circulating enteroviruses [75] . As an historical event, the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus appears to have acquired its hemagglutinin-esterase gene by recombination with an influenza type C virus [46] . Also, the alphavirus Western equine encephalitis virus probably resulted from an ancient recombination between a Sindbis-like and a Easter-equine encephalitis-like virus (reviewed in [87] ). The emergence of the SARS coronavirus around 2002 probably involved the transfer of the virus from a bat to a carnivore (probably a civet cat); contact with civets may have facilitated the human outbreak. The human ACE2 receptor-binding sequences used by the human SARS coronavirus may have been acquired by recombination with a preexisting group 1 human coronavirus [45] . In this, and in the other cases in which recombination played a role in the generation of a new pathogen, selection of virus variants for a more efficient replication in the new host (for receptor use or other) probably took place [91] . Genome segment reassortment is a major evolutionary force for some viruses with a segmented genome, the most studied case being reassortments in the influenza type A viruses. Reassortants that have acquired the hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase genes from viruses of some animal reservoirs (notably birds or swine) have been associated with the major human influenza pandemics such as the Spanish influenza of 1918 (H1N1 virus), the Hong Kong influenza of 1968 (H3N2 virus) or the pandemics of 2009 (H1N1 virus) [35, 66, 74] . Such viruses acquired a selective advantage relative to previously circulating influenza viruses because the new hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase surface antigens were not recognized (or were only poorly recognized) by the neutralizing antibodies present in the human population. The acquisition of new genome segments that produce a change in antigenic specificity is termed antigenic shift. The gradual antigenic modification undergone by the virus as it circulates in the human population is termed antigenic drift. The latter is linked to point mutations that affect the antigenic determinants, and can be regarded as the fitness adjustment by mutation as the virus explores new environments (some of which include anti-influenza antibodies) following a reassortment event. Drastic and gradual versions of antigenic variation are not exclusive of influenza virus, and they have been amply recognized as a major factor in the adaptation of viruses to host organisms endowed with an immune system [48, 67] . Viruses are undoubtedly subjected to selective constraints additional to the several components of an immune response, and some of them probably have not even been identified. Multiple constraints contribute to shape the genomic compositions of the viral populations as they complete successive life cycles. Mutation, recombination and reassortment can produce new viral forms, a minority of which might be competent to replicate in a new environment. There is evidence that a true recombinant hemagglutinin might have been one of the virulence determinants of the influenza pandemics of 1918 [28] .

On 11 September 2012, a Qatari man in his forties with severe respiratory illness was transferred from Qatar to a United Kingdom hospital and was admitted to the intensive care unit for progressive hypoxia and renal failure. Extensive diagnostic tests on upper and lower respiratory tract samples for a causative agent were negative. The pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay, however, yielded a correct band size (208 bp) that corresponded to the conserved RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene of coronavirus in lower respiratory tract specimens. Assays for detection of known human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, -HKU1 and SARS-CoV were negative [12] . A comparison of the PCR fragment sequence with the nucleotide sequence of HCoV-EMC isolated from case 1, showed that they shared 99% identity, indicating the same viral infection.

In another study, also aiming at gene transfer, lactobacilli were made to express an ScFv called aDec that targets Dec205, a receptor on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) [122] . Three anchoring strategies were used: covalent anchoring to the cell membrane (Lipobox), covalent anchoring to the cell wall through an LPXTG anchor (CWA) and non-covalent anchoring to the cell wall using a LysM domain (LysM). This study revealed clear differences between the anchoring strategies. Surface location of the antibody could only be demonstrated for the strains with cell wall anchors (CWA and LysM) and only these two strains showed increased uptake into DCs in vitro, as well as increased plasmid transfer from the lactobacilli to DCs. Interestingly, in mice experiments, the highest plasmid transfer was observed for the strain in which aDec was coupled to the cell membrane (Lipobox). It is conceivable that in the case of Lipobox anchoring aDec is more embedded in the cell wall and thus better protected from the harsh conditions in the GIT of the mice.

Many LAC countries score poorly on the WASH index, which is a measure of access to abundant clean water and improved sanitation. If increased transmission due to fecal contamination is combined with climatically reduced contact transmission, the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 in LAC may be fundamentally distinct from the dynamics currently observed in the Northern Hemisphere. We can look to the epidemiological characteristics of norovirus and cholera in LAC for insights. In LAC slums with poor water access and sanitation, over 80% of children are infected with at least one strain of norovirus in their first year of life [16] ; adults are only infected when novel genotypes enter the community. Cholera is a disease of poverty exacerbated by poor access to clean water. During the 1991 cholera epidemic in Peru, cholera spread nearby instantaneously from a single town to nearly communities along the Peruvian coast with attack rates over 2% in just the first month of the epidemic [17] . Because cholera is often transmitted via contaminated stored water and food, up to half of all family members show signs of infection within two days of the presentation of an index case [18] . If COVID-19 spreads in a similar fashion, we can expect increased intrafamily and intraneighborhood infection rates. Like norovirus, this may result in rapid herd immunity within infected communities [16] ; however, with a large peak of simultaneous infections, local health centers will almost certainly be overwhelmed. Extreme rates of local infection can cause complex metapopulation dynamics that could favor rapid local eradication while at the same time facilitating long-term regional viral persistence [19] . In the face of this, LAC will need to implement widespread population surveillance of both active cases (using RT-PCR) and prior exposure and potential immunity via serology.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has shown the importance of implementing nonpharmaceutical approaches, like physical distancing, to contain the spread of the virus and to avoid overburdening health care systems. The strain of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the disease spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth. These droplets are typically expelled when someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks. Thus, a primary mode of disease transmission is via close social contacts, which generally occurs when a susceptible individual breathes in droplets from an infected individual, or touches his or her face after physical contact with those droplets (1) . The rapid spread of the virus across countries and continents, and the associated death toll, have led to the introduction of strong public health measures to contain the disease. These measures include travel restrictions, school closures, the cancellation of large gatherings, the promotion of physical distancing practices, and, in some countries, a full-scale nationwide lockdown. In the absence of a vaccine and effective viral treatments, the policies that have so far been implemented are largely non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed at changing the magnitude of social mixing patterns, which is a key factor in shaping the course of the epidemic. Thus, how people respond to these interventions is a critical factor to consider when assessing the effectiveness of public health measures designed to contain the disease and to prevent new waves of infection.

Hyperimmune or immune eggs are laid by hens that have typically been stimulated with inactivated microorganisms or purified antigens. Stimulation of the hens results in the formation of eggs containing high level of antibodies, predominantly the IgY class (Warr et al., 1995; Aveskogh and Hellman, 1998; Schade et al., 2005; Nilsson et al., 2007; Dias da Silva and Tambourgi, 2010) . Passive immunization by oral administration of specific antibodies has been an attractive approach against gastrointestinal pathogens in both humans and animals. Immunoglobulin Y is an alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of various infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens [e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Coronavirus, and Rotavirus (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002; Liou et al., 2011) ]. The immunity transfer from a mother to the newborn does not only depend on immunoglobulin. Colostrum and milk are rich in proteins and peptides, which play a regulatory role and may stimulate the neonate immune system. Peptides, which are characterized by immunoregulatory properties that accompany IgG 2 , have been discovered for the first time in ovine colostrum (Janusz et al., 1974) . Because of high proline residue content, they are referred to as proline-rich polypeptide complex (PRP), subsequently named Colostrinin. The complexes similar to PRP were also found in human, bovine, and caprine colostra (Piasecki et al., 1997; Sokołowska et al., 2008) .

MERS-CoV is a disease caused by a coronavirus and results in severe acute respiratory disease including fever, chills, cough, and dyspnea. Some patients also develop nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It has a 30% mortality rate. Most patients who have died had underlying comorbidities and developed pneumonia or renal failure. The illness was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012; most cases appear to be limited to the Arabian Peninsula. The incubation period ranges from 2 to14 days. The illness can spread from person to person but it requires close contact, and no sustained transmission had been reported by late 2014. The virus could evolve and lead to sustained transmission, but this cannot be predicted with certainty. There is no vaccine for MERS-CoV and there is no specific treatment, but there is ongoing research by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other entities to fill this gap. 24

The novel coronavirus pneumonia is an acute respiratory disease. In December 2019, this disease emerged in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government called it SARS-CoV-2 which was subsequently named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. In January 2020, WHO confirmed it as a sustained human to human disease [2]. By March 2020, COVID-19 had been transmitted round the world rapidly and every day large number of new cases were registered.

On 31 December 2019, China alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to several cases of an uncommon pneumonia in Wuhan, the most populous city in Central China with >11 million people. The causal pathogen was unknown. In the initial stages, severe acute respiratory infection symptoms appeared, and some patients also quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and other additional problems of a severe nature. On 7 January, a new coronavirus was recognized by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the throat swab sample of a patient, 1 and then officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the WHO. Since then, the disease has quickly spread from Wuhan to other regions. Now, the WHO has declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic, with substantial occurrences in >100 countries around the world, with cases rapidly increasing at the time of publication of this Commentary. 2 Understanding the detailed clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is of paramount importance to identify subjects at the highest risk of (i) being infected and (ii) presenting with a particularly severe clinical presentation which may lead to death. Recent reports from China, such as a study from Wang et al., 3 have demonstrated that old age as well as additional underlying health conditions significantly increases the risk of dying from infection. Importantly, cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, appears to be particularly linked to the severity of COVID-19. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In a large-scale report from China's CDC, 7 patients who needed admission to an intensive care unit were more likely to have comorbidities, the majority of which were cardiovascular-or diabetes-associated. Even though the mortality rate remains highly variable depending on the region (currently 2.3% in China, and >9% in Italy or Spain), the large-scale analysis of 44 672 confirmed COVID-19 cases indicated an increased mortality risk for older patients (14.8% for patients > _80 years of age), and for those with diabetes (7.3%), hypertension (6%), and cardiovascular disease (10.5%).

The ubiquitous form of feline coronavirus is readily passed cat-to-cat by the fecal-oral route and is the cause of a mild or unapparent enteritis. Like coronaviruses in general, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is undergoing constant mutation within its accessory and structural genes. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is a highly fatal systemic disease, is a sequel of FECV infection in a small proportion of cats. The virus isolated from the diseased tissues of cats with FIP is highly related to the FECV identified in the feces. Although SNP and deletion mutations were common between isolates from the same cat, only the 3c gene was rendered non functional by such mutations. Deleterious mutations in 3c tend to be found in diseased internal tissues, while viruses with intact 3c are found mainly in the feces. While deleterious mutations of the 3c gene were seen in all 8 FIP cats in this study, and in virtually all previously reported FIPVs, they are by no means a universal finding. However, there is compelling evidence that when they do occur, they are the cause of FIP and not an effect of the disease. Deleterious 3c gene mutants will readily cause FIP when inoculated into laboratory cats, whereas their largely non-pathogenic fecal counterparts with intact 3c genes are readily transmitted from one cat to another. These gene 3c mutants, when they occur, are unique to each cat with FIP, indicating that they arise independently in each host and not by mutation in one cat with subsequent horizontal spread to others. Several minor variants can co-exist in both tissues and feces and when two variants are inoculated together into the same cat, one or the other, but not both, will predominate. The high mutability of feline coronaviruses leads to minor genetic differences between cats in one closely contained geographic area, while significant genetic differences are seen between isolates from geographically disparate regions. More in depth studies on the function of the feline coronavirus 3c gene will be important for determining its precise role in FIP.

The seropositive of HKU8r-CoV in camels is another example linking a bat CoV to camels besides MERS-CoV and 229E-related coronavirus, thereby strengthening the bat-camel connection theory [27, 28] . The finding of two closely related NeoCoV and PREDICT/PDF-2180 CoV in bats suggested that MERS-CoV descended from an ancestral virus of African bats, while the host switch from bats to dromedary camels likely occurred in Africa years ago [27, 29, 30] . However, there has been no other reported virus spillover from bats to camels beside this ancestral MERS-CoV and 229E-related coronaviruses. Our data demonstrated that the HKU8r-CoV NP antibody is not caused by cross-reactive antibody responses to camel 229E. Our discovery of HKU8r-CoV in camels is, therefore, an important finding. HKU8r-CoV was described first in Hong Kong and later in Kenya, and so far it has only been reported in Miniopterus bat species [23] [24] [25] . Kenyan bats carry multiple CoVs including SARS-related, HKU2-related, HKU7-related, HKU8-related and HKU9-related CoVs that may spillover to other species in rural areas where bats roost in close proximity to humans or are consumed by humans as bush meat [24] .

Electron microscopy appearance and genome order ( Fig. 5 .1) of 5′replicase-structural (spike-envelope-membrane-nucleocapsid)-polyT-3′ on complete genomic sequencing are similar to other members of Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV is phylogenetically distinct from any of the three groups of known coronaviruses. Human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 belong to group 1 van der Hoek et al., 2004) ; human coronavirus OC43 belongs to group 2, and group 3 consists of all the avian coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein of 139 SARS-CoV isolates in the Hong Kong outbreak showed that several introductions had occurred but only one of them was associated with the major outbreak in Hong Kong and the rest of the world . Some of the strains found in the early stages of the outbreak were phylogenetically distinct from the major cluster and were closer to some of the Guangdong and Beijing strains. This concurred with the fact that the index patient of the Hong Kong outbreak was a Guangzhou medical doctor who had traveled to Hong Kong. Another molecular epidemiological study of a Guangdong outbreak suggested that the disease spread from Guangdong to Hong Kong and the rest of the world, and the index case was a chef who handled game animals . Subsequent animal surveillance in China recovered coronavirus isolates that have a nucleotide homology of 99.8% with the SARS-CoV . A characteristic 29-base insertion between open reading frames (ORF) 10 to 11 (also named as ORF8a and 8b) was found in these animal isolates Snijder et al., 2003) . This 29-nucleotide segment was deleted after or before crossing the species barrier to humans. The biological effect of this deletion remains elusive. A number of SARS-CoV in the later stages of the epidemic showed larger deletions around this site (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). Two independent molecular epidemiological studies comparing the complete genome of 12 and 63 virus isolates also found evidence of a strong positive selection at the beginning of the epidemic that is followed by a purifying selection, as indicated by the amino acid substitution rate at the spike, Orf3a, and nsp3 (The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Yeh et al., 2004; Song et al., 2005) . Both studies suggested that molecular adaptation of the virus had occurred after interspecies transmission from animals to humans. In the small outbreak of Guangzhou in 2004, all four human isolates belonged to a separate sublineage with the concurrent animal, predominantly civet cat, isolates that are distinct from the human pandemic or animal virus of the 2003. Though the SARS-CoV is distinct from the three existing groups of coronaviruses, it may be closer to group 2 because 19 out of 20 cysteines found in the S1 domain of the spike protein are spatially conserved when compared with the group 2 consensus sequence, whereas only 5 cysteine residues are conserved when compared with that of the groups 1 and 3 Snijder et al., 2003) . Because coronaviruses are believed to have co-evolved with their animal hosts, it was possible that rats, mice, and cattle harboring group 2 coronaviruses are more likely to be the animal host for SARS-CoV than cats, which harbor group 1 coronavirus. However when a comparison of the phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and nucleocapsid sequences of 36 coronaviruses was done using an interference approach with sliding window analysis, there is statistical incongruence that indicates multiple host-species shifts between the coronaviruses of many animals that are phylogenetically distant (Rest and Mindell, 2003) . Thus, even if the civet cats or other related mammals are the true animal reservoir rather than mice and rats, it would not be too big a surprise. Moreover, the civet cats and other related mammals had at least served as a major amplification mechanism in the markets of southern China irrespective of the original animal reservoir. The control of these animals and the markets plays a pivotal role in the epidemiological control of SARS. Genomic evidence of another animal-to-human interspecies transmission events was demonstrated in a small outbreak of four cases in early 2004 in Guangzhou (Song et al., 2005) . A metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from Vero E6 cells was found to bind the S1 domain of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003c) . The 293T cells transfected with ACE2 can form multinucleated syncytia with cells expressing the spike. ACE2 expression is detected by immunohistochemical staining on enterocytes, pneumocytes, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Hamming et al., 2004) . This is compatible with the clinical and histopathological manifestations of SARS, which include diffuse alveolar damage, colonic mucosal presence of abundant viral particles in a patient with diarrhea, and pulmonary vasculitis and thrombosis. The lack of virus infection in some cell lines that express ACE2 has led to a rush for finding coreceptors for cell entry . Recently, a C-type lectin called L-SIGN was shown to be an alternative receptor for binding and cell entry (Jeffers et al., 2004) , although it is not clear whether this is a functional receptor for the virus that can lead to productive virus replication. Murine ACE2 binds less efficiently with the S1 domain of SARS-CoV, and even less well with rat ACE2, which suggests that efficient replication in the mouse or rat is limited by their ACE2 type (Greenough et al., 2005) .

Coronaviruses are large (28-32 kb) single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses (fi gure 2). 18 To enter host cells, MERS-CoV attaches to its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4. Protease cleavage of the S protein is then required for virus-cell fusion and release of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm. Viral RNA transcription and replication occurs on double membrane vesicles and other membranous structures, which are derived from the endo plasmic reticulum. Transcription of the seven subgenomic mRNAs occurs via negative-strand subgenomic RNA intermediates. Subgenomic RNAs are 3ʹ co-terminally nested and are joined to a common leader encoded at the 5ʹ end of the genome. Viral RNA is encapsidated in the virus replication encoded at the 5ʹ end and structural proteins encoded by genes at the 3ʹ end of the genome (fi gure 2). 3 Accessory proteins, which are not required for virus viability, are interspersed throughout the structural genes and might interfere with the innate immune response in infected animals. MERS-CoV has fi ve diff erent accessory proteins and SARS-CoV has eight diff erent accessory proteins, which share no sequence similarity. These diff erences, which presumably have diff erent eff ects on induction and signalling of type 1 interferon, could explain why MERS-CoV is more sensitive to interferon than is SARS-CoV. 19, 20 This diff erence in interferon sensitivity has implications for treatment because type 1 interferon has been used to treat patients infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 21, 22 Coronaviruses have high rates of mutation and recombination and a propensity to cross host species. 18 Although this property was most clearly shown by the spread of SARS-CoV from Chinese horseshoe bats to human populations during the 2002-03 epidemic, other coronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus, or feline coronavirus-II, canine coronavirus-II, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (swine virus) are very closely related, consistent with cross-species transmission. 23 This ability to adapt to new environments raised concerns that MERS-CoV would gain virulence and an enhanced ability to transmit from person to person, but this has not occurred.

In general, virus with neuroinvasive potential could invade CNS cell though transneuronal route, or hematogenous route, or both, as a result of viral encephalitis and various neurological disorders, and the infection of CNS is finally confirmed by laboratory examinations (Desforges et al., 2014) . In the early March 2020, medical workers from Beijing Didan Hospital reported the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with encephalitis whose cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, raising the concern that SARS-CoV-2 might spread from respiratory tract to CNS. Since then, increasing number of attention are given to the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is currently the only case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with positive findings in CSF. A retrospective consecutive case series indicated 78 of 214 patients presented neurological symptoms, including central nervous system (CNS) symptoms (e. g. headache, dizziness), peripheral nervous system (PNS) impairments (e. g. taste impairment, smell impairment), and skeletal muscular injury (Mao et al., 2020) .

At this time, COVID-2019 is spreading its foot in the form of a huge epidemic for the world. This epidemic is spreading its foot very fast in India too. One of the World Health Organization states that COVID-2019 is a serious disease that spreads from one person to another at very fast speed through contact routes and respiratory drops. On this day, India and the world should rise to an effective step to analyze this disease and eliminate the effects of this epidemic. In this paper presented, the growing database of COVID-2019 has been analyzed from March 1, 2020, to April 11, 2020, and the next one is predicted for the number of patients suffering from the rising COVID-2019. Different regression analysis models have been utilized for data analysis of COVID-2019 of India based on data stored by Kaggle in between 1 March 2020 to 11 April 2020. In this study, we have been utilized six regression analysis based models namely quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, sixth degree, and exponential polynomial respectively for the COVID-2019 dataset. We have calculated the root mean square of these six regression analysis models. In these six models, the root mean square error of sixth degree polynomial is very less in compared other like quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, and exponential polynomial. Therefore the sixth degree polynomial regression model is very good models for forecasting the next 6 days for COVID-2019 data analysis in India. In this study, we have found that the sixth degree polynomial regression models will help Indian doctors and the Government in preparing their plans in the next 7 days. Based on further regression analysis study, this model can be tuned for forecasting over long term intervals.

A large number of molecular biologic and sequencing studies established that the coronaviruses share a common genetic organization and mode of replication. Infected cells contain a set of 6 to 9 virus-specific polyadenylated RNAs that make up a 3 co-terminal nested set, with the largest member of this set being the genome RNA and the remaining RNAs representing subgenomic mRNAs. The subgenomic RNAs encode the structural proteins enumerated above in a characteristic order: HE (if present)-S-E-M-N. In addition to these structural genes, coronavirus subgenomic RNAs encode accessory proteins that are not essential for viral replication. They generally modulate cellular responses to infection and are specific for each coronavirus subgroup. The replicase proteins are encoded in the 5 two-thirds of the genome. This region contains two very long partially overlapping open reading frames that are translated by a ribosomal frame shifting mechanism. The ∼750-kDa primary translation product is cotranslationally autocatalytically cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that encode the machinery needed for RNA replication and transcription. Many of the coronaviruses are associated with respiratory or enteric diseases, although some viruses replicate and cause disease at other sites, including the liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Most of the coronaviruses are relatively species specific, only infecting their natural host and cell cultures derived from that host or a closely related host species. However, there are several examples of coronaviruses jumping species, with SARS-CoV being the most well known example. SARS-CoV is thought to have originated in bats, where SARS-like CoVs have been identified, and then transmitted to civets and raccoon dogs in wild animal markets in Southern China, from which they were subsequently transmitted to humans (Lau et al., 2010) . During this chain of transmission, several key adaptations to the new host occurred (Li et al., 2005a,b) . CCoV and FeCoV provide another exception to the high degree of species specificity of coronaviruses, in that both viruses are able to grow in feline cells. Phylogenetic analysis of the group Ia coronaviruses, CCoV, FeCoV, and TGEV, suggest a complex set of recombination events has given rise to these viruses from a common ancestor, likely explaining the ability of both CCoV and FeCoV to infect feline cells (Wesseling et al., 1994; Lorusso et al., 2008) . The species specificity of coronaviruses is controlled by the ectodomain of the S protein, and can be altered by creating chimeric S proteins that contain the ectodomain of a distantly related CoV (Kuo et al., 2000) .

In the absence of a universal vaccine that covers all possible strains and subtypes of influenza virus, many countries have implemented stockpiling vaccine programmes to store vaccines against influenza virus strains with pandemic potential for emergency first responders to alleviate the problem imposed by the rapid spread of pandemic influenza. Although preparing for potential pandemic threats is sound public health policy, it is not compelling to assume that the influenza A H5N1 viruses (or the more recently detected H7N9 virus (March 2013)) are pandemic precursor strains because they are associated with the largest numbers of human infections among animal influenza A virus strains. First, over the past 130 years, only viruses expressing an H1, H2 or H3 HA have been responsible for seasonal or pandemic strains. Avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses have most likely circulated for at least as long without spilling over into humans and starting a new pandemic162. Accordingly, these ‘avian’ HA influenza viruses are unlikely to easily transmit from person to person. Second, the high case fatality rates cited by the WHO for H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in humans seem to be an artefact of the way they were calculated (that is, counting only patients who were hospitalized as having been infected by these viruses); many more people seem to have been infected by these viruses without severe outcomes163,164. Additionally, severe disease only results from exposure to large quantities of the virus, which can occur when people are in direct contact with diseased poultry. However, transmission of seasonal or pandemic influenza viruses requires only small quantities of virus (estimates vary between 2–25 virions165 and 50–400 virions166) to cause severe disease and transmission.

T he novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has recently emerged as a human pathogen in the city of Wuhan in China's Hubei province, causing fever, severe respiratory illness, and pneumonia-a disease recently named COVID-19 (1, 2) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 16 February 2020, there had been >51,000 confirmed cases globally, leading to at least 1600 deaths. The emerging pathogen was rapidly characterized as a new member of the betacoronavirus genus, closely related to several bat coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4) . Compared with SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV appears to be more readily transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple continents and leading to the WHO's declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (1, 5, 6) .

The present study adds to our knowledge of genetic drift among feline coronaviruses that inhabit the same cat, multi-cat household, cattery, or geographically distant region. All of the FIPVs and FECVs isolated from the five cats that had close contact with each other in Sonoma, California were ≥99% related (Tables 1 and 3; Figure 1 ). Based on gene sequences and historical facts, it can be reasonably concluded that cat Simba was infected with an FECV following contact with cat Lucy. This supported another correlate of the internal mutation theory; FECVs are easily spread cat-to-cat, while FIPVs are not. Addie et al. [33] also noted that the same strain of coronavirus tended to persist among any given group of cats. However, coronaviruses within a closely housed group of cats, and even within the same cat, undergo continuous genetic drift. We observed sequence differences of 1-2% or less in cats from the same group, while genetic drift between cats from distant areas of the western US was on the order of 6-16%. Herewegh et al. [34] also found that feline coronaviruses from individuals within the same environment had unique genetic fingerprints and fell within the same clade, while geographically distant isolates belonged to genetically unique clades. The notable mutational drift observed among feline coronaviruses across geographic regions, in the face of genetic conservation within stable groups of cats, is paradoxical. However, the evidence indicates that coronavirus infection in any group of cats originates from a single founder virus, that virtually every cat in a group is infected rapidly and efficiently, and that cats appear to resist superinfection with closely related strains [34] . The single founder virus effect was confirmed in the present study (Table 4) . Thus, marked genetic drift occurs when a single coronavirus strain is serially passed from one susceptible population to the next. This scenario was supported by our animal transmission studies; when cats were simultaneously infected with two closely related variants of FIPV, each variant segregated into different cats. Therefore, minor mutants may become predominate when passed cat-to-cat.

The present-day pandemic spotlight on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) was earlier placed on Zika virus, H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), chikangunya, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. The "advancements" of the human race-increased urbanization, global travel, changes in land use, and fervent exploitation of the nature-are also the prime reasons for zoonosis and emergence of novel infectious diseases such as above (Madhav et al. 2017; Ahmed et al. 2019) .

With a C-terminal Gly, Atg8 and Atg12 are primed for three-step activation by Atg7 Mizushima et al., 1998) . First, Atg7 ''activates'' the otherwise inert UBL C terminus in a MgATP-dependent reaction, by catalyzing C-terminal adenylation of the UBL. Second, Atg7's catalytic Cys attacks the activated UBL C terminus, AMP is released, and a covalent, presumably thioester-bonded Atg7UBL intermediate is produced, (Brownell et al., 2010; Ichimura et al., 2000; Mizushima et al., 1998) . Third, each autophagy UBL is transferred from Atg7's Cys to that of its cognate E2, resulting in thioester-linked Atg12Atg10 or Atg8/LC3Atg3 intermediates. More than a dozen structures of Atg7 or its domains-complexes with MgATP, Atg8, Atg10, and Atg3-provide insights into many aspects of this process (Hong et al., 2011; Kaiser et al., 2013; Noda et al., 2011; Taherbhoy et al., 2011; Yamaguchi et al., 2012) .

Large animal models in development include camels and camelids such as alpacas (19, 26, 27) . These models may be vital in understanding the virology and immunology of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries, a natural host. In addition, serologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection in alpacas has been reported in Qatar (28) . Major gaps for all animal models include a lack of consensus and availability of the optimal animal model to replicate severe human illness from MERS-CoV infection; limited availability of currently or recently circulating MERS-CoV strains; the lack of understanding of clinically relevant symptoms that can be incorporated into clinical scores or used as a signal to begin treatment in animal models; and competition for funding, laboratory space, availability of animals, and expertise with other emerging or reemerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease and Zika virus disease. (29, 30) . The Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services declared a potential public health emergency on May 29, 2013, regarding MERS-CoV infection that could have a high potential to affect national security or the health and security of US citizens living abroad. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) subsequently issued an emergency use authorization to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) for an in vitro molecular diagnostic test to diagnose MERS-CoV infection in multiple types of clinical specimens from symptomatic patients. The use of this test was later expanded to include the ability to test asymptomatic contacts of a person infected with MERS-CoV who traveled from Saudi Arabia to the United States. The CDC made this test available to multiple US public health laboratories, the US Department of Defense, and WHO laboratories worldwide. Although the test has been distributed extensively, it is limited in terms of the CDC's ability to scale up the supply of reagents to support a surge in MERS-CoV cases in the United States and in other countries where the test has been made available. Therefore, an emergency use authorization was issued on July 17, 2015, for the commercially developed RealStar MERS-CoV RT-PCR Kit U.S. (Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) for use in the in vitro qualitative detection of MERS-CoV RNA in tracheal aspirate or tracheal secretion samples (31) . Although this commercial assay is a first step in bridging the diagnostic test availability gap in case of a surge scenario, the current coverage, at least in the United States, is insufficient until alternative, FDA-cleared commercial tests are available (Table 2) .

Dear Editor, we read with great interest the article by Cesare Zoia, Daniele Bongetta, Pierlorenzo Veiceschi, Marco Cenzato, Francesco Di Meco, Davide Locatelli, Davide Boeris, and Marco M. Fontanella "Neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: update from Lombardy, northern Italy" [4] . This study provided important insights into the management of patients with the COVID-19 disease discovered in Wuhan [5] and the interpretation of these findings may be enhanced by the following considerations. In Italy since February 2020 spread a massive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with a great number of infected patients and deaths. To contrast the infection spread on March 2020 in Italy was declared the lockdown and the neurosurgical activity of the Department of Neurosurgery AOU Ancona-Italy was centered on emergency and oncological pathology. In consideration that human coronaviruses could start from the respiratory tract and spread to the central nervous system through transneuronal and hematogenous routes as reported by Desforges M. et al. in 2014, we must assume that also the new COVID-19 might infect the central nervous system too [1, 2] . In this light, all neurosurgical departments should perform an early diagnosis and a correct management of all suspect infected patients to prevent the diffusion of the infection itself to the neurosurgical area [3] . Firstly the general rule is that all patients transferred from one hospital to another undergo a swab test before the transfer. In nonhospitalized patients admitted to hospital for urgent surgery, a swab test is performed but, because of the long time for its result, when a surgical procedure is urgent a pulmonary CT scan is performed to search for a COVID-19 pneumonia. In fact in emergency surgery, a pulmonary CT scan is the only method for a fast potential diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. In COVID-19-positive patients, surgery is performed with adequate personnel protections and dedicate path in the postoperative period. In our hospital to concentrate resources on COVID-19 emergency, the non-urgent activities were suspended and each department provided some of its doctors and nurses to reinforce the COVID-19 staff. To face the danger of contagion even in our neurosurgical department, measures have been implemented such as the suspension of all scheduled surgical activity with the exception of class A for oncologic patients, maintenance of neurosurgical emergencies (cerebral hemorrhages, hydrocephalus, tumors with intracranial hypertension, spinal cord compression, and traumatic cranial and spinal), and the urgent neurosurgical visit or the scheduled ones within 10 days. Luckily during this lockdown the cranial and spinal traumatic pathology decreased dramatically allowing the medical staff to be more available for COVID-19 emergencies. Unexpectedly there was a drop in the request of surgical treatments also for pathologies unrelated to traumatology (Fig. 1) . While the decline of traumatology is explained by the block of car traffic and work activities, the demand decrease for neurosurgical treatment in spinal degenerative pathology appears incomprehensible. A possible reason could be the widespread fear of the population to go to hospital seen as a dangerous place for a possible infection. Another potential reason may be This article is part of the Topical Collection on Neurosurgery general the patients' overestimation of their disability and pain with consequent neurosurgical overtreatment. We should investigate if since now we have been surgically treating too many patients who might have been healed by anti-inflammatory drugs and real long rest as is probably occurring now.

Objective: To infer Covid19 incubation time distribution from a large sample. Method: Based on individual case data published online by 21 cities of China, we investigated a total of 136 COVID19 patients who traveled to Hubei from 21 cities of China between January 5 and January 31, 2020, remained there for 48 hours or less, and returned to these cities with onset of symptoms between January 10 and February 6, 2020. Among these patients, 110 were found to be aged 15 to 64, 22 aged 65 to 86, and 4 aged under 15. Findings: The differential incubation time histogram of the two age groups 15 to 64 and 65 to 86 are adequately fitted by the log normal model. For the 15 to 64 age group, the median incubation time of 7.00+1.10 - 0.9 days (uncertainties are 95 % CL) is broadly consistent with previous literature. For the 65-86 age group, the median is 10.9+2.7 - 2.0 days is statistically significantly longer. Moreover, for this group, the 95 % confidence contour indicates the data cannot constrain the upper bound of the log normal parameters μ, σ by failing to close there; this is because the sample has a maximum incubation time of 17 days, beyond which we ran out of data even though the histogram has not yet peaked. Thus there is the potential of a much longer incubation time for the 65 to 86 age group than 10 to 14 days. Only a much larger sample can settle this.

The population behavioural response to the presence of the COVID-19 is an important feature of physical distancing [10, 16, 28, 39, 46] . Hence, we also assumed that transmission outside of schools and workplaces is reduced by individual physical distancing efforts (restricting social contacts, washing hands, etc) and that more confirmed positive cases in the county cause more individuals to practice physical distancing. Each individual travels from their home county to another county for the day with some probability that is reduced if schools and workplaces are closed in the destination county. The model is parameterized with epidemiological, demographic, and travel data from Ontario, Canada.

Like the SIRD model used in our previous study [1] , this SEI s I a R s R a D model does not accommodate any spatial information about the infection spread. In other words, there is no spatial degree of freedom in the governing equations of SEI s I a R s R a D model. The spatial dependence of the disease progression can be executed via simulating this model on a lattice or connected network. The network may feature the following attributes: (a) every node on the network virtually carries the territorial/regional information collected from the map of India; (b) the network connectivity bears the details of human mobility, transmission spread from one region to another. The network nodes also can account for the topology/geography of India in a coarse-grained manner. For example, the nodes representing Himalayan highlands would likely to be attributed lesser human mobility and transmission spread compared to the nodes representing Indian metro cities. This proposed model would enable us to study how the infection spreads from a few initial local pockets to a larger region, thereby rendering a broader picture of the dynamics of the pandemic. A previous study investigating the COVID-19 progression in Italy describes a novel approach using a spatially explicit SEIR model [18] . Future investigation with similar spatial/topological detailing in India's context would be useful to delve into. Also, note that the current SEI s I a R s R a D model is a generalized model. It does not contain any specific biological/clinical features of the COVID-19 disease. In this model, COVID-19 enters through the rates and governing parameters in Equations (1) to (12) that are tuned to obtain the best fit of the theoretical curves with the available COVID-19 data.

The Australian strains of SARS-CoV-2 were dispersed across the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (Fig. 1A) . The first four cases of COVID-19 disease in NSW occurred between 24 and 26 January 2020, and these were closely related with 1-2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) difference to the dominant variant circulating in Wuhan at the time (prototype strain MN908947/SARS-CoV-2/Wuhan-Hu-1). As the four patients identified in this period had recently returned from China, this region was the likely source of infection. From 1 February 2020, travel to Australia from mainland China was restricted to returning Australian residents and their children, who were placed in home quarantine for 14 days. Despite the intensive testing of such returning travellers, no further cases of COVID-19 were detected in NSW until 28 February 2020, when SARS-COV-2 was detected in an individual returning from Iran (NSW05). A close contact of this individual also tested positive (NSW14) providing the first evidence of local transmission within NSW. This was followed by further Iran travel-linked cases in NSW (NSW06, NSW11, NSW12, and NSW13) and New Zealand (NZ01).

The Guardian mentioned in an article of 25 March cases of prejudice against chinese people in italy, that ca. 310,000 chinese people are living in italy, being the 3rd largest foreign community, with more than half of them settled in northern italy, and ca. 30,000 living and working in Prato (Tuscany), the center of italian textile industry (11) . Though the current consensus in the West is that coVid-19 entered italy from china, it does not appear that the workers of Prato are the original carriers of the virus, as the initial outbreak of infection was not observed in Prato. in a mathematical model developed by researchers in Shanghai, it was calculated that 34 unobserved infected people travelling out of china in the very beginning of the epidemic would have been enough to create what we see today (12) . Given the fact that commercial collaboration between china and the rest of the world is strong, it is apparent that during January thousands of people (chinese and europeans) travelled from china to europe. obviously, some of them were already infected, and most probably, their numbers were higher than 34. considering that lombardi has 3 very busy international airports (Malpena, linate, and Bergamo), has strong commerce, and has a great number of international events organized constantly in the area, it is safe to assume that a number of infected people, directly from china but also through other countries (as the case of the so-called italian patient 'one'), entered italy in that period. consequently, it is very probable that it was not only one patient 'zero' but many.

Several coronaviruses infect the human respiratory tract, and usually cause mild disease; however, the beta coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe zoonotic respiratory disease. SARS emerged in 2002 in Guangdong province, China, and caused an epidemic leading to 8096 cases and 774 deaths globally in more than 25 countries across five continents, but was contained through public health interventions. MERS-CoV transmits from dromedary camels to humans, sometimes leading to clusters of human-to-human transmission, especially within health-care facilities. To date, within health-care facilities, with 2519 cases, with 866 deaths across 27 countries, have been confirmed as of January, 2020. 1 In December, 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused an outbreak of respiratory illness (coronavirus disease 2019; in Wuhan, China. Within 5 months, the disease burden and fatalities have surpassed both SARS and MERS, with more than 2 million confirmed cases and more than 150 000 deaths reported globally, as of April 19, 2020. 2 WHO declared this outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although the virus appears to be more transmissible than either SARS or MERS, disease severity is variable-from asymptomatic to fatal-and case fatality appears to be substantially lower than both SARS and MERS. 3 Modes of transmission and pathogenesis have been key knowledge gaps. The virus is assumed to be primarily transmitted by large respiratory droplets, but there has been no direct evidence for this hypothesis. Identifying the organs and cell types that are permissive to implantation and virus replication will help to understand the portals by which the infection can be established. To our knowledge, to date there has been only one autopsy study reporting a patient dying after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 using needle core samples and one histopatho logical study on two patients undergoing lobectomy. 4, 5 Although these studies have provided information on the histopathology of COVID-19, they did not include characterisation of SARS-CoV-2 virus trop ism by immunohistochemistry, and therefore do not shed light on virus tropism in the early stages of the infection process. 4, 5 Thus, data from experimental infection of ex-vivo cultures of the respiratory tract are needed.

The current pandemic has rocked the lives of human beings every-where in ways never imagined, forcing us to question where our civilization is headed. In this article, we explore and discuss scien-tifi c evidence that helps explain recent events in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 is caused by infection with a zoonotic-origin novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, that is genetically close to two coronavirus types iso-lated in bats. The transmission dynamics to humans from the original and intermediary hosts remain poorly understood, but it is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected humans after undergoing an inter-species transfer from bats to an intermediate species, and from there to human beings. Crossing the species barrier is largely fostered by industrial-scale agricultural practices that simplify original ecosystem connections by reducing biodiversity, facilitating the emergence of new infectious diseases. The scientifi c community has played an exemplary role in responding to this global emergency, working to fi nd timely, relevant solutions for governments and society as a whole. We need to take this opportunity to promote a global and open science that delves into the interrelation-ships of the biological, environmental, social and economic dimen-sions of this and other diseases while questioning current modes of production and their impact on the environment, and thus on human health worldwide.

Several biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) pathogens are high-consequence, single-stranded RNA viruses, and their genomes, when introduced into permissive cells, are infectious. Moreover, many of these viruses are select agents (SAs), and their genomes are also considered SAs. For this reason, cDNAs and/or their derivatives must be tested to ensure the absence of infectious virus and/or viral RNA before transfer out of the BSL-3/4 and/or SA laboratory. This tremendously limits the capacity to conduct viral genomic research, particularly the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we present a sequence-independent method to rapidly amplify viral genomic RNA while simultaneously abolishing both viral and genomic RNA infectivity across multiple single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA+) virus families. The process generates barcoded DNA amplicons that range in length from 300 to 1,000 bp, which cannot be used to rescue a virus and are stable to transport at room temperature. Our barcoding approach allows for up to 288 barcoded samples to be pooled into a single library and run across various NGS platforms without potential reconstitution of the viral genome. Our data demonstrate that this approach provides full-length genomic sequence information not only from high-titer virion preparations but it can also recover specific viral sequence from samples with limited starting material in the background of cellular RNA, and it can be used to identify pathogens from unknown samples. In summary, we describe a rapid, universal standard operating procedure that generates high-quality NGS libraries free of infectious virus and infectious viral RNA. IMPORTANCE This report establishes and validates a standard operating procedure (SOP) for select agents (SAs) and other biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) RNA viruses to rapidly generate noninfectious, barcoded cDNA amenable for next-generation sequencing (NGS). This eliminates the burden of testing all processed samples derived from high-consequence pathogens prior to transfer from high-containment laboratories to lower-containment facilities for sequencing. Our established protocol can be scaled up for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, which can dramatically reduce the cost and effort required for NGS library construction. NGS data from this SOP can provide complete genome coverage from viral stocks and can also detect virus-specific reads from limited starting material. Our data suggest that the procedure can be implemented and easily validated by institutional biosafety committees across research laboratories.

Positive-sense RNA viruses span multiple virus families, and the infectious nature of these genomic RNAs coupled with SA/biosafety/biosecurity concerns inhibit rapid removal from BSL-3/4 containment (7) or transport and handling of RNA samples that are known to contain viral genomes from outbreak settings. This poses a challenge for timely sample processing and sequence analysis, which could significantly hamper responses during outbreak situations. Typically, all products generated from infectious material must be proven to no longer contain infectious viral particles or infectious genomic RNA prior to transfer to a BSL-2 space. Confirming loss of infectivity (LOI) typically occurs via blind infectivity testing, where a subset of the material is placed on a permissive cell line for at least three subsequent passages (8) . For this reason, transferring cDNAs or other nucleic acids from a BSL-3/4 laboratory to a BSL-2 laboratory is a very difficult and time-consuming process for many laboratories. Some investigators have worked out procedures that have been approved by their institutional biosafety committee; however, these procedures vary from institution to institution. For example, some BSL-3 facilities work with mosquito-transmitted ssRNAϩ viruses including West Nile virus (WNV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) that are not considered SAs. Other BSL-3 facilities contain ssRNAϩ viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) that are classified as SAs, but these facilities have safety protocols that allow transfer of genomic RNA or cDNA from BSL-3 to BSL-2 directly by scientists. Finally, there are BSL-3 facilities working with SAs such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). Here, only trained safety personnel are allowed to transfer cDNA samples from high-containment laboratories to BSL-2 laboratories after inactivation has been carried out under a validated protocol. For each of these scenarios, a robust, universal standard operating procedure (SOP) to eliminate infectious material while rapidly generating next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries is critically needed.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-stranded enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, and are classified into four genera: a, b, d and g. Two of the b-CoVs, the server acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have caused serious epidemics. In November 2002, SARS emerged in southern China and then was spreading across the world in 2003, resulting in ~8,000 cases with a fatality rate of about 10% (WHO, 2004) . Ten years later, MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia and spread to different countries with a fatality rate of about 35% (WHO, 2016) . Both viruses are of zoonotic nature: SARS-CoV originates from bats/civet cats (Ge et al., 2013) , and the major reservoir for MERS-CoV is dromedary camels (Reusken et al., 2016) . Nevertheless, both viruses can be transmitted from human to human (de Wit et al., 2016) .

Fusion with, and subsequent entry into, the host cell is one of the critical steps in the life cycle of enveloped viruses. For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the spike protein (S) is the main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates the process of membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium ions (Ca2+) play an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by screening a mutant array in which E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP were substituted with neutrally charged alanines (A). Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested their ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells in modulating Ca2+ environments. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Subsequent electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry showed an approximate 1:1 MERS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, as opposed to an 1:2 SARS-CoV FP to Ca2+ ratio, suggesting significant differences in FP Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity.SignificanceMERS-CoV is a major emerging infectious disease with zoonotic potential and a reservoir in dromedary camels and bats. Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. In order to develop novel drugs and vaccines, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable the virus to infect host cells. Our data has found that calcium is an important regulator of viral fusion by interacting with negatively charged residues in the MERS-CoV FP region. This can guide therapeutic solutions to either block this calcium interaction and also repurpose already approved drugs for this use for a fast response to MERS-CoV outbreaks.

Nathaniel Byers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO, USA) presented a method for longitudinal mosquito saliva collection for determining arbovirus vector competence that increases biosafety and throughput. The recent emergence of Zika, chikungunya and yellow-fever viruses emphasizes the need for rapid, reliable, and safe methods for analyzing vector competence from various species of mosquitoes. Arboviruses transmit from the mosquito to the vertebrate host via mosquito saliva; hence, collecting mosquito saliva to assess viral titers is an essential activity. Current collection methods are laborious and typically require sacrificing the mosquito, limiting researchers to a single saliva collection time point per insect. Inspired by the hanging blood drop and the field-oriented honey-trap method, they are designing an approach that will allow collection of saliva from individual mosquitoes during routine sugar feeds. They have systematically optimized this assay: including methods of sucrose delivery, housing, timing, and detection of virus from samples. A 3D printed lid covered with organdy turned 12-well plates into suitable habitats for both Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, as they provided a compact living space for individual mosquitoes and improved safety over cartons. To detect chikungunya virus from experimentally infected mosquitoes, quantitative reverse-transcription real-time PCR, normalized to a standard curve, was performed on RNA purified from mosquito saliva samples. This collection technique is a promising method for assaying arbovirus transmission rates over time from experimentally infected mosquitoes as it facilitates rapid longitudinal collection of infected saliva from individual mosquitoes. Also, by eliminating the need for glass capillaries and reducing manipulation of mosquitoes, this technique improves biosafety, saves time and allows for increased numbers of mosquitoes per experiment.

The emergence of global supply chains exposes economies to risks that go beyond their territorial borders. Beyond natural hazards and man-made disasters, the world is unprepared to handle epidemic outbreaks such as the COVID-19 outbreak. From its first reported case on December 30, 2019, the number of confirmed cases has grown at an exponential rate and continues to rise to date. As of this writing, more than 89,000 individuals have been infected (with more than 7000 cases outside of China) and more than 3000 have died.

Hypusine [N ε -(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine], a derivative of spermidine, is covalently conjugated to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) at a lysine residue (Lys50 in human) via two consecutive enzymatic reactions: first, the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) catalyzes the transfer of the aminobutyl moiety from spermidine to the lysine residue in eIF5A which in turn is hydroxylated by deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) 49 (Figure 1 ). eIF5A is the only known hypusinated protein in nature and this hypusination is absolutely required for its function. 50 The role of eIF5A in mRNA translation has been extensively studied but its actual function is still in question. eIF5A was first purified from rabbit reticulocytes as a ribosome-associated translation initiation factor and shown to stimulate methionyl-puromycin synthesis, suggestive of a role in the formation of the first peptide bond. 51 However, analyses using eIF5A-deficient yeast S. cerevisiae showed that global protein synthesis was inhibited by only 30%, suggesting that it has a non-essential role in protein synthesis. 52 Depletion of eIF5A in mammalian cells using siRNAs also displayed only a marginal effect on global translation rate (decrease by ∼10%). 53 Thus, it was hypothesized that eIF5A may function in a different stage of translation or affect only a subset of mRNAs.

The current pandemic has rocked the lives of human beings every-where in ways never imagined, forcing us to question where our civilization is headed. In this article, we explore and discuss scien-tifi c evidence that helps explain recent events in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 is caused by infection with a zoonotic-origin novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, that is genetically close to two coronavirus types iso-lated in bats. The transmission dynamics to humans from the original and intermediary hosts remain poorly understood, but it is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infected humans after undergoing an inter-species transfer from bats to an intermediate species, and from there to human beings. Crossing the species barrier is largely fostered by industrial-scale agricultural practices that simplify original ecosystem connections by reducing biodiversity, facilitating the emergence of new infectious diseases. The scientifi c community has played an exemplary role in responding to this global emergency, working to fi nd timely, relevant solutions for governments and society as a whole. We need to take this opportunity to promote a global and open science that delves into the interrelation-ships of the biological, environmental, social and economic dimen-sions of this and other diseases while questioning current modes of production and their impact on the environment, and thus on human health worldwide.

Current evidence indicates that COVID-19 is mainly transmitted from person to person through droplets, contact, and even high concentrations of aerosols [6] . Large amounts of droplets and aerosol are generated by sputum suction in the airway, specimen collection, tracheal intubation, fiber bronchoscopy, tracheotomy, etc. Accordingly, surgeons are at a great risk of contamination. In order to avoid occupational exposure, recommendations during the aerosol-generating procedures in COVID-19 patients are the following: Statement 3 If possible, COVID-19 patients should probably be admitted to negative pressure rooms (Grade 2+, weak recommendation).

Aminopeptidase N exists as a heavily glycosylated homodimeric protease on the surface of a very broad range of cell types, including epithelial cells of kidney and intestine, endothelial cells, cells of the nervous system (i.e., cerebral peritocytes at blood-brain barrier and synaptic junctions), myeloid cells (monocytes as well as antigen-presenting cells) and fibroblasts [34] [35] [36] . APN is also localized to the apical surface of polarized respiratory epithelium, the site at which HCoV-229E infection starts [38] . In addition, pulmonary dendritic cells are an important source of APN expression and have been hypothesized to capture and transmit HCoV-229E from the respiratory epithelium to susceptible cells in other parts of the body, possibly contributing to viral spread during an infection [39] . Amino acids 260-353 from APN have been identified as an essential domain for binding HCoV-229E. Within this protein region, eight residues (i.e., amino acids 288-295) are critical for virus receptor activity [40] . This HCoV-229E binding region is not identical to the active site of APN and mutations in the catalytic domain do not affect CoV infection, implying that APN protease activity is not involved in CoV entry [41] . After binding APN, HCoV-229E presumably utilizes a caveolae-mediated internalization mechanism for host cell entry [42, 43] . This pathway involves endocytosis via specialized lipid rafts (caveolea), plasma membrane localized microdomains, rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which serve to concentrate membrane-associated proteins (e.g., viral receptors) [44] . Notably, human APN is known to be a component of lipid rafts from various cell types [42, 45, 46] . Initially, human APN was also suspected to be the receptor for HCoV-NL63, since HCoV-NL63 S protein harbors most amino acid sequence similarity (56%) with the spike protein of HCoV-229E [10] . Nonetheless, ACE2 acts, quite surprisingly, as the functional HCoV-NL63 receptor [25] .

Details on SARSCoV2 importation to Germany have been previously described by Rothe and colleagues. 7 In brief, the primary case (patient 0) stated that her parents, who normally live in Wuhan, had arrived for a visit in Shanghai on Jan 16. Both parents recalled coldlike symptoms the week before, and one parent showed fatigue and loss of appetite while visiting. Patient 0, who was an employee of the Chinese branch of a German company based in greater Munich, travelled from Shanghai to Munich by aeroplane on Jan 19, 2020, to facilitate workshops and attend meetings in the company building. The day after arrival (Jan 20, 2020), patient 0 felt chest and back aches-which she reported to be unusual-and took a single dose of medicine containing paracetamol. The patient reported fatigue during her whole stay in Germany and attributed the symptom to jetlag. After an overnight flight back to Shanghai on Jan 22, the patient felt feverish. With a self measured temperature of 38·6°C and cough on Jan 24, the patient visited a physician's office on Jan 25. The patient tested positive for SARSCoV2 on Jan 26 and was hospitalised the next day. The clinical situation in both parents also deteriorated during the primary case's stay in Germany and both were laboratoryconfirmed with COVID19 later. 7 The German company was informed of the primary case's infection in the morning of Jan 27, 2020, and immediately informed its employees as well as the local health authority.

SARS causes flu like symptoms including high fever, cough, difficulty breathing and pneumonia, and can spread from person to person by close contact via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. No specific anti-SARS treatments or vaccines are available [5] . SARS is caused by a newly identified virus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6] . SARS-CoV is a ~100 nm diameter, enveloped, single strand RNA virus containing a 30 kb genome with 14 open reading frames. SARS-CoV has four major structural proteins, the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [7] . The S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for virus binding and virus penetration. It is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity [8, 9] . The S protein has been the main target antigen for most SARS vaccines being developed [1, [10] [11] [12] [13] 33 ].

This is one of the oldest sampling techniques based on thermophoresis principle in which air laden with aerosol and bioaerosol is passed through a narrow channel containing a temperature gradient perpendicular to the air flow. On entering the temperature gradient the airborne particles tend to move away from the hot surface towards the cooler surface and depositing over it, a phenomenon known as thermophoretic motion (Waldmann and Schmitt, 1966) .The hot surface is generally heated up to 125°C while the other collecting surface is cooled by a circulating water heat exchanger. Immediate microscopic examination can be done is glass microscopic cover slips that are used as the cooler collection surface or if collected over filter paper from which the deposits could be transferred to agar plates to allow colonies to grow and examined thereafter (Kethley et al., 1952 and Orr et al., 1956) . The collection efficiency of such sampling technique is very high for small particles ranging from b0.01 μm to 5 μm, when the temperature gradient is sufficiently maintained all throughout the sampling time, and thus this method is used to determine the particle size distribution (Watson, 1958) . Although its collection efficiency for smaller particles is high yet its collection rate is very low in comparison to other samplers ranging from 7 cm 3 min − 1 to 1 L min − 1 (Cox and Wathes, 1995) . Thus because of such low rate sampling and requirements of very precise adjustments, such samples are not commonly used in industries (Kang and Frank, 1989 ).

An unknown outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan with some uncommon extrapulmonary symptoms in patients, like anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting, not necessarily with respiratory symptoms, was caused by SARS-CoV-2, with the disease being termed COVID-19. It is spread from person to person in the community. Some patients showed lower ability to respond to treatment after hospitalization and developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, ARDS, or multiple organ failure (Mo et al. 2020; Pan et al. 2020) . The clinical variety of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to respiratory failure to multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and MODS. The symptoms in the early stages of infection were non-specific, and differential diagnosis may include a variety of infectious and non-infectious etiologies (Cascella et al. 2020) . This study used a random-effects model, with the assumption that each of the included investigations used randomly selected samples for analysis. The high heterogeneity of each variable type observed in the studies was due to the different periods in which the studies were carried out and the diversity of locations, cultures, and economic status. The cause of liver damage in COVID-19 was due to SARS-CoV-2 being similar to SARS-CoV and could invade the human body by binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which causes liver tissue injury by upregulation of ACE-2 expression in liver tissue ). a b Fig. 4 a Forest plot of randomeffects meta-analysis for alanine aminotransferase (ALT). b Funnel plot with pseudo 95% confidence interval for ALT Our meta-analysis study observed that the pooled mean of albumin in COVID-19 patients was lower than the normal range, which is due to a defect in its synthesis. The AST pooled mean value was reported to be higher in COVID-19 patients, which is due to damage in hepatic tissue storage. A study suggests that, as the disease progresses, patients encounter secondary infection, which further causes abnormal liver function, due to (1) viral infection directly causing damage to liver cells and (2) drug-related liver damage (Liu et al. 2020a) .

Out of the hundreds of coronavirues, 7 of them are known to cause human disease and only 3 of the 7 can have more serious outcomes in people including SARS, MERS and 2019-CoV. 13 Similar to SARS and MERS, patients infected with 2019-CoV exhibited symptoms of viral pneumonia including fever, difficulty breathing, and bilateral lung infiltration. 14 In the most severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. 15 However, the disease may occur with mild symptoms only, including: low-grade fever, cough, malaise, runny nose, sore throat but without any warning signs, 16, 17 which made early detection challenging. Epidemiological evidence shows that 2019-nCoV can be transmitted from person to person among close contacts possibly through respiratory droplets. The acute respiratory infection has an incubation period of 2-14 days before any symptoms show. Preliminary data report 11% lethality among hospitalized patients. 16 At the time of this manuscript's authorship, there was no specific medicine or vaccine for coronavirus 2019-nCoV. 17, 18 According to the cases identified in Macau, the impact of 2019-CoV on human health appears to be mild, and the first patient with the confirmed diagnosis had full recovery and been discharged on February 6, 2020. 19 Such information is important for community pharmacist to know, convey and employ. Being able to address the public enquires with accurate up-to-date information about the local situation and the overall infection progress is the key to build trustful relationship with them at troubled times. This will in turn improve the outcomes of educating the public about the preventative measures of the 2019-CoV outbreak and the early recognition of symptoms.

There is also a set of so-called structural proteins such as spike glycoproteins, an envelope protein, membrane proteins, and the nucleocapsid. One of the structural proteins, the spike surface glycoprotein ("spike glycoprotein"), is one of the primary therapeutic targets. This protein plays an important role in binding to receptors on the host cell, fusion of the host and viral membranes, and as a target for antibodies (reviewed in Fung and Liu 7 ).

A dataset was constructed to examine Vietnamese student's learning habits during the time schools were suspended due to the novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), in response to a call for interdisciplinary research on the potential effects of the coronavirus pandemic (Elsevier, 2020). The questionnaires were spread over a network of educational communities on Facebook from February 7 to February 28, 2020. Using the snowball sampling method, researchers delivered the survey to teachers and parents to provide formal consent before they forwarded it to their students and children. In order to measure the influence of students' socioeconomic status and occupational aspirations on their learning habits during school closures, the survey included three major groups of questions: (1) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status, school type, and occupational aspirations; (2) Student's learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (3) Students' perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. There was a total of 920 clicks on the survey link, but only 460 responses accompanied by consent forms were received. Non-credible answers (e.g., year of birth after 2009, more than 20 hours of learning per day) were eliminated. The final dataset included 420 valid observations.

The aristolochic acid hypothesis nevertheless fails to explain one of the defining features of BEN, i.e., the geographical confinement. Aristolochia plants are widely cultivated and are probably native in many places in Europe, Asia, and North America, places where no cases of BEN or a BEN-like disease have been documented.. Also, even though many herbal remedies are used locally in the BEN areas, it is unlikely that Aristolochia leaves, seeds, or roots are ingested on such a widespread scale in the endemic locations (3) . The pungent repulsive odor of the plant makes it equally unlikely to be accidentally ingested, even on an endemic scale. In addition, the pelviureteric sclerosis found in one of the biopsied cases of Chinese herb nephropathy reminds more of analgesic nephropathy than BEN. Viruses A viral etiology of BEN was hypothesized based on the endemic character of the disease, the seasonal variation in the incidence and deaths from BEN, and on the discovery of viral particles in the kidneys of some afflicted persons (55) . The high frequency of urothelial tumors in BEN patients may also be explained by infection with slow oncogenic viruses. Several viruses have been considered as possible agents: the West Nile virus, papilloma viruses (BK and SV40) (56, 57) , coronaviruses (20) , and arenaviruses (58) . An extensive search for these viruses in BEN patients has been unsuccessful so far. For example, the West Nile virus (a mosquito-borne flavivirus that caused more than 300 cases of meningoencephalitis in the Danube flood lands, including Bucharest, Romania, in 1996), is probably not involved in BEN because only a few of the investigated BEN patients exhibited antiviral antibodies. The same is true for the BK and SV40 viruses. Although high titers of anti-BK and -SV40 antibodies were found in some of the BEN patients, such antibodies are also frequently encountered in the general healthy population. Coronaviruses transmitted from pigs in the endemic households were suggested as a possible cause for BEN (20) . However, evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. More likely candidates for a viral etiology are rodent-borne viruses such as those responsible for hemorrhagic fever (HF) syndromes. Some of these viruses (Puumala, Hantaan, and Dobrava in the Balkans) can cause more or less severe HF with renal syndrome in rural or urban areas. The classic Hantaan disease in rural China (epidemic HF) and in Korea (Korean HF) has a seasonal pattern of incidence, being most common in spring or fall, possibly in relation to agricultural practices and rodent density (59) . Infection in humans is acquired through aerosols of rodent urine; the disease is not transmitted from human to human. Some of the features of Hantaan HF are seen in BEN-disease endemicity, incidence in rural settlements, and seasonal variation-but BEN is primarily a chronic kidney disease without any acute episode in its evolution. In contrast, the Hantaan infection usually evolves with acute renal failure. There is an analogy worth mentioning between BEN and the Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, an arenaviral HF disease spread by rodents (58) . As discussed by Radovanovic (58) , both diseases are characterized by similarities in the topography of the disease area (flat plains, in river or stream valleys), clustering only in certain setdements and households, lack of evidence of human-to-human transmission, and the first recognition of both diseases after the beginning of malaria control programs using DDT after World War II. Although the evidence is speculative, Radovanovic (58) postulates that residual DDT sprayed in the Balkans in the mid-1940s led to the reduction in the number of cats, the most important natural barrier against rodents in the endemic (and nonendemic) households. As a result, a decade later, the rodent reservoir expanded and BEN emerged and was described for the first time as a disease entity.

When the pandemic spread from Asia to Europe it took some time to realise its possible consequences and what would be appropriate measures to prevent these consequences. Also the USA seemed to ignore what was happening in Asia and Europe for some time, causing a considerable delay in introducing defensive policies when the pandemic finally reached the country. In a country like the USA where little social security exists and government is not prepared to invest money in preparing for disasters the societal consequences are possibly even larger than in Europe [12] . This was also one of the lessons learned from the storm Katrina [8] , but the lack of preparedeness still remains.

Viruses with pandemic potential including H1N1, H5N1, and H5N7 influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)/Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged in recent years. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods, sometimes up to months. Factors influencing the survival of these viruses on surfaces include: strain variation, titre, surface type, suspending medium, mode of deposition, temperature and relative humidity, and the method used to determine the viability of the virus. Environmental sampling has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, although the frequent use of molecular detection methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus. The importance of indirect contact transmission (involving contamination of inanimate surfaces) is uncertain compared with other transmission routes, principally direct contact transmission (independent of surface contamination), droplet, and airborne routes. However, influenza virus and SARS-CoV may be shed into the environment and be transferred from environmental surfaces to hands of patients and healthcare providers. Emerging data suggest that MERS-CoV also shares these properties. Once contaminated from the environment, hands can then initiate self-inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth. Mathematical and animal models, and intervention studies suggest that contact transmission is the most important route in some scenarios. Infection prevention and control implications include the need for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to minimize self-contamination and to protect against inoculation of mucosal surfaces and the respiratory tract, and enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection in healthcare settings.

Since its emergence from Guangdong province in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been unique on several fronts. Firstly, the disease is caused by a new member of the family Coronaviridae, with distinctive properties, setting it apart from the two other coronaviruses that are already known to cause the common cold in human beings. 1 Secondly, during its early emergence, it infected many healthcare workers (HCWs), including the index case from Guangdong, who transmitted the infection to individuals coming from different parts of the world. 2 global epidemic of a new emerging infection, which has been managed at an international level using the latest technology available as is described in the following: (a) the internet for rapid, 24 h communication across all affected countries and time zones to exchange clinical and technical information; [9] [10] [11] (b) modern virological methods including both traditional whole animal/cell culture and electron microscopy, 12, 13 and the newer molecular biological techniques that enabled the whole genetic sequence of the new virus to be obtained within 2 months of the onset of the global epidemic; 14, 15 and (c) the rapid investigation of compounds for possible active agents to treat or immunize against the new illness. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Because the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is known to be highly infectious, the impact on critical (intensive) care units (ICU) is of particular interest. It was in the ICUs that many of the patients with severe SARS died, and many of the initial wave of hospital-acquired or nosocomial transmissions of this new coronavirus virus occurred. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Origins It is thought that SARS CoV is a zoonotic virus, and studies of Guangdong wildlife are ongoing at present to determine its origin. 35, 36 The hypothesis is that due to the wide variety of exotic wild animals that are consumed as food delicacies in Guangdong province, in Southern China, the transmission of SARS CoV from animal to man occurred during capture, handling, preparation or consumption of these animals. This was supported by anecdotal reports that some patients, who had SARS in Guangdong Province in November and December of 2002, reported a history of occupational exposure to these exotic wild animals. Interestingly, two out of the recent four cases of SARS occurring early in 2004 had documented exposure to civet cats in a restaurant serving exotic wild animals and environmental samples taken from that restaurant were positive for SARS-CoV genome by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This has lead to the subsequent cull on these animals recently initiated by China. 37, 38 A comparison can be drawn with other zoonotic viruses such as influenza, and Nipah virus, which have also recently emerged from the region of Southeast Asia. 39, 40 Current animal candidates for the natural reservoir of SARS CoV include the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) and the racoon dog (Nyctereutes procyo-noides). 35, 36 There has also been a suggestion that the black rat (Rattus rattus) may also play a role as a vector. 41 The identification of the natural reservoir for the new SARS CoV has important practical public health implications because once it has been identified, it may be possible to limit the exposure and thus prevent further transmissions to susceptible people, thus minimizing the risk of another SARS epidemic. An interesting finding for SARS CoV strains isolated from the civet cat species was that the genome sequence was 29 nucleotide bases longer than the SARS CoV isolated from human SARS cases. It was suggested by the authors who reported this finding that this implied that it was therefore more likely that the virus had passed from civet cat to man, rather than vice versa. 36 The recent and ongoing re-emergence of SARS in a few patients in Guangdong province in China in early 2004 38, 42, 43 shows that this virus may well become seasonal, and that clinical teams, globally, should remain alert for unsuspected SARS patients from such affected areas.

Zunyou Wu (Chinese Center for Disease Control and prevention, Beijing, China) gave an overview of the early events of the SArS-CoV-2 pandemic. the first three cases of CoVID-19 were confirmed between 27 December 2019 and 1 January 2020 and an alert was raised by the local health authority with the closure of the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan [8] . As of 7 January, SArS-CoV-2 was identified and the first pCr kits were sent to Wuhan. As of 23 March, Wuhan and 15 other cities were 'shut down'. It only took 42 days for the virus to spread from 14 counties in 1 province to >1600 counties in 31 provinces. the majority (84%) of confirmed cases outside Hubei were explained by either a Wuhan-related exposure, or a close contact from a confirmed case, which suggests a low level of community transmission outside Hubei. no meaningful differences in age distribution of CoVID-19 cases were observed between sexes. the majority (94%) of patients were adults between the ages of 20 and 79 years.

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the family of CoVs that infect humans. Four human CoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) are able to cause a wide range of upper respiratory tract infections (common cold), whereas SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are responsible for atypical pneumonia. The causes of different infection sites are likely related to the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lower respiratory tract, which are the major human receptors for the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [22] [23] [24] . The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is ≥70% similar to that SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 is capable of using the same cell entry receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV to infect humans [25 , 26] . However, there are more differences in the key S proteins that the viruses use to interact with host cells. SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to human ACE2 with approximately 10-20-fold higher affinity than the SARS-CoV spike [19] , making it easier to spread from human to human.

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in humans, mammals, and birds. In humans, the virus causes respiratory tract infections which are mild but may be lethal in some cases. Coronaviruses are a group of an RNAvirus and also known as a 2019-nCov virus. Coronaviruses are viruses in the subfamily Orthocoronaviridae, of family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and have a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry [8, 31] . The genomic size of coronavirus varies from 26 to 32 kilobase [7] . Coronaviruses are categorized into four genera i.e. alpha, beta, delta and gamma, where alpha and beta are responsible for causing infection in humans [17] . There are seven strains of human coronaviruses Viz. Human coronavirus 229E(HCoV-229E), Human coronavirus OC43(HCoV-OC43), SARS-CoV, Human coronavirus NL63(HCoV-NL63, New Heaven Coronavirus), Human Coronavirus HKU, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) previously known as novel coronavirus 2012 and HCoV-EMC, Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also known as Wuhan pneumonia or Wuhan coronavirus. The coronaviruses HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1 frequently circulate in human population and cause respiratory infection in adults and children. The incubation period for human coronavirus is 2-5 days [15] . As it is communicable disease and transfer from one person to another person through a droplet and direct contact [9] . The recent identification of fourth human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63 was diagnosed from a 7-month-old child who suffers from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. Symptoms of coronavirus are feeling tired, difficulty in breathing, fever, coughing and sore throat. As the symptoms are similar to other respiratory diseases including flu and common cold. In this review, we have explained the actual mechanism of coronavirus and its overexpression in the cell membrane ( Fig. 1 ).

Transgenic lettuce leaf tissues were analyzed for the detection of LTB-COE fusion protein using immunoblot detection methods with antibodies against LTB or COE. Transgenic leaf tissues were homogenized by grinding in a mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen and extracted with extraction buffer (1:1 w/v) (200 Mm, Tris-Cl; pH, 8.0; 100 mM, NaCl; 400 mM, sucrose; 10 mM, EDTA; 14 mM, 2-mercaptoethanol; 1 mM, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 0.05%, Tween-20). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g in a Beckman GS-15R centrifuge for 15 min at 4ºC to remove insoluble cell debris. An aliquot of the supernatant containing 100 µg of total soluble protein, as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Inc., Hercules, CA), was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at 100 V for 1.5 to 2 h in Trisglycine buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, 250 mM glycine, pH 8.3, and 0.1% SDS). The separated proteins were transferred from the gel to a Hybond C membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) using a Mini Trans Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 130 mA in the transfer buffer (50 mM Tris, 40 mM glycine, 0.04% SDS, 20% methanol, and pH 8.3). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation of the membrane in 20 mL of 5% non-fat dry milk in a TBS buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 500 mM NaCl) for 1 h with gentle agitation on a rotary shaker (40 rpm), followed by washing in a TBS buffer for 5 min. The membrane was incubated overnight at room temperature with gentle agitation in a 1:2,000 dilution of rabbit anti-LTB antiserum (Immunology Consultants Lab Inc., USA) or mouse anti-COE monoclonal antibody in TBST antibody dilution buffer (TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% non-fat dry milk) followed by 3 washes in a TBST buffer (TBS with 0.05% Tween-20). The membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation in a 1:7,000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Promega) in an antibody dilution buffer. The membrane was washed twice in a TBST buffer and once in a TMN (100 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 5 mM MgCl 2, and 100 mM NaCl) buffer, as before. After washing, the color was developed with BCIP/NBT (USB, Cleveland, OH) in TMN buffer. The expression levels of plant-expressed LTB-COE fusion protein and their affinity for G M1 -ganglioside receptor were determined by G M1 -ELISA [34] . The microtiter plate (Becton Dickinson Labware, USA) was coated with 100 µL per well of monosialoganglioside G M1 (3.0 µg/mL) (Sigma) dissolved in bicarbonate buffer (15 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 35 mM Na-HCO 3 , and pH 9.6), covered with Saran wrap and incubated at 4ºC overnight. The wells were washed 3 times with PBST and blocked by adding 300 µL/well of 1% BSA in PBS and incubated at 37ºC for 2 h, followed by washing 3 times with PBST. The wells were loaded with centrifuged transgenic lettuce leaf extracts (5 µg of protein) with serial dilutions (100 µL per well) and purified bacterial LTB (5 ng of protein) as a standard curve, and incubated overnight at 4ºC. The wells were washed 3 times with PBST and loaded with 100 µL per well of a 1:8,000 dilution of rabbit anti-LTB primary antibodies and incubated for 2 h 37ºC, followed by washing the wells 3 times with PBST. The plate was then incubated with 100 µL per well of secondary antibody, a 1:20,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antirabbit IgG (Sigma) for 2 h at 37ºC and washed 3 times with 300 µL of PBST per well. The plate was finally incubated with 100 µL per well of TMB substrates L (PharMingen, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. The plate was measured at a 405 nm wavelength in an ELISA reader (Packard Instrument, USA). The affinity of plant-expressed LTB-COE fusion protein for G M1 -ganglioside receptor was detected and the amount of LTB-COE fusion protein synthesized in the transgenic plant was estimated based on the known amount of purified bacterial LTB.

Piglets are born immunocompetent and their mucosal immune system is equipped with innate immune defense mechanisms, which provide the first line of defense against pathogens [22] . However, they are agammaglobulinemic at birth and their adaptive immune system is immature. Thus, they cannot rapidly mount protective immune responses against infections including RV [23, 24] and rely on protection by colostrum and milk-derived Abs during early life [25] . Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most prevalent isotype in colostrum and protects against systemic infections, while secretory IgA (sIgA) is prevalent in milk and is associated with the local (mucosal) defense system [26] [27] [28] . Isotype switching from IgM to IgA occurs mainly in the germinal centers in the gutassociated-lymphoid tissue (GALT). The transfer of IgA plasmablasts from the gut to the mammary gland and the eventual release of sIgA into milk in swine is documented but not well understood [29] [30] [31] . Although some knowledge of lactogenic immunity against RVA and enteric coronaviruses was generated using porcine and rodent animal models [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] , lactogenic protection of piglets against RVC has not been evaluated. In contrast to RVA, RVC pathogenesis is poorly understood and the role of maternal passive immunity in alleviating the clinical disease not been studied. Intriguingly, although RVA diarrhea is rare in suckling piglets and becomes more prevalent after weaning, suckling status does not seem to mitigate RVC diarrhea in piglets. However, whether it is associated with insufficient levels of maternal RVC Abs or with low minimum RVC infectious dose (compared with other swine enteric viruses) is not known [15, 18-20, 38, 39] .

Recently, much has been conducted to track the high-resolution transmission history of viruses by using full-genome sequencing. Transmission network of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia was reconstructed using full genome sequences Cotten et al., 2013) . Emergence and evolution of Norovirus in Sydney was investigated by using genetic sequences (Eden et al., 2014) . Evolution of Rift Valley fever virus during an outbreak in Kenya during 2006-2007 was described using genome sequences (Bird et al., 2008) . In this study, we constructed the transmission pathway of the spread of PPR virus basing on the fulllength genome sequences and identified five clusters of infections. Farms in each clusters showed dispersed geographical location, with farm-to-farm distance ranging from 360 km to 3400 km. It indicated that such transmission between farms was caused by long-distance animal movement. Putative-ancestor-virus-centered radial shape of each cluster suggested that samples collected from different province might come from a same virus origin. Previous epidemiologic analysis suggested that infected animals in different provinces could be traced back to some national livestock markets (Fan et al., 2015) . These animals were found bought from the market and transferred thousands of kilometers away to the farms by trucks. The incubation period of PPR is typically 4-6 days, which may range between 3 and 14 days. According to the convenient highway network in China, it is suggested that the infected animals which were during incubation period were transferred from Xinjiang province to some national livestock market and then mixed with sheep and goats in the market. It is of most possibility that the suspected animals in the market were infected with PPR and were transferred to the farms in other provinces by longdistance translocation during incubation period.
13957649	Spread	brain	spinal cord					1318460		0	0	2	2	4	5	Spread from brain to spinal cord appeared to occur via cerebrospinal fluid .	An antigenic variant of the neurotropic murine coronavirus JHMV, designated 2.2-V-1, causes marked demyelination in the relative absence of encephalitis. It is thus useful for the study of the pathogenesis of demyelinating lesions. To better understand the sequential events leading to demyelination, we have examined murine brain and spinal cord tissue at daily intervals after intracerebral inoculation, evaluating them for the distribution of viral antigen, leukocyte infiltration, and demyelination. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that virus established primary infection in the ependymal cells in both brain and spinal cord before spreading into nearby structures and along white matter tracts by cell-to-cell contact. Spread from brain to spinal cord appeared to occur via cerebrospinal fluid. Viral replication was focally cytocidal for ependymal cells, and essentially noncytocidal for other neural cells including glia. In brain, viral antigen and inflammation reached a peak at day 5 postinfection, and rapidly subsided by day 10 postinfection. In spinal cord, viral antigen was less abundant than in brain and was maximal between days 7 and 9 postinfection. The inflammatory response and demyelination, however, were more severe persisting from day 7 through day 19. In the spinal cord, demyelinating lesions developed initially in areas closer to the central canal and were detected most prominently in the anterior funiculi. This finding suggests that the permissiveness of the ependymal cell is crucial to viral entry and that sequential infection of glial cells leads to the characteristic distribution of demyelination.

(MERS) coronavirus were tested by undertaking drills that encompassed detection of a suspected Ebola virus disease case and transfer from the airport to the reference hospital (with whom stand-by arrangements had been made beforehand) (task I1). Communication to travellers is paramount so that any at-risk travellers can report to the health authorities for medical screening and a 21-day followup. Nevertheless, we felt that in some airports in Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives and Nepal, the authorities had recently lowered their guard on communication and advice to travellers, probably due to Ebola preparedness fatigue. This situation may increase the risk of a traveller with incubating Ebola virus entering the country and not reporting voluntarily (particularly those travelling from a non-affected third country; task I6).

Epithelial cells display polarity, that is they have an apical surface facing the outside world and a basolateral surface facing the interior of the body, the two separated by lateral cell-cell tight junctions. These surfaces are chemically and physiologically distinct. Viruses that are shed to the exterior (e.g., influenza viruses) tend to bud from the apical plasma membrane, whereas others (e.g., lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus) bud through the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4.9) . In type I budding, as with the alphaviruses, both the envelope glycoproteins and the internal capsid are essential. If altered or chimeric envelope proteins reach the plasma membrane, these do not support budding, indicating that the quaternary structures of the envelope heterodimers and capsid are involved in driving the process. Type II budding, for example Gag-dependent budding of many retroviruses, requires only the internal capsid or matrix proteins. Type III budding can be driven solely by the envelope proteins. Finally type IV budding is driven by viral matrix proteins but requires additional components; for example, internal matrix proteins alone can drive the budding of rhabdoviruses or orthomyxoviruses. but the process is inefficient or results in deformed particles unless envelope glycoproteins or the internal ribonucleoprotein are also present.

Viruses that bud from apical surfaces can be shed in respiratory or genital secretions or intestinal contents. Viruses budding from basal surfaces are available for systemic spread via viremia or lymphatics. Some viruses, for example, flaviviruses, bunyaviruses, and coronaviruses, take a more circuitous route in exiting the cell. Viruses that do not bud are usually released by cell lysis. Reproduced from MacLachlan, N.J., Dubovi, E.J., 2011. Veterinary Virology, fourth ed. Academic Press, London (Figure 2.11), with permission. Flaviviruses, coronaviruses, arteriviruses, and bunyaviruses mature by budding through either membranes of the Golgi complex or the rough endoplasmic reticulum; vesicles containing the virus then migrate to fuse at the plasma membrane thereby releasing the virions by exocytosis (Fig. 4.8) . Uniquely, the envelope of the herpesviruses is acquired by budding through the inner lamella of the nuclear membrane; the enveloped virions then pass directly from the space between the two lamellae of the nuclear membrane to the exterior of the cell via the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Studies investigating HPIV transmission indicate small particle aerosol spread is unlikely as documented by the aerosol studies of Mclean et al. (1976) where only 2 of 40 children were infected with HPIV1 when exposed at a distance of 60 cm. In 1991, Ansari et al. demonstrated that parainfluenza virus could be transferred from stainless steel surfaces to clean fingers, and that HPIV3 remained viable on hands longer than 1 h. The Ansari and Mclean studies suggest that fomites may play a role in the spread of HPIV. CDC publications also suggest that HPIV can be spread through contact with contaminated respiratory secretions from an infected individual or a contaminated surface (CDC 2009). Pathogenic virus contamination of fomites has been documented in the indoor environments of hospitals (coronavirus, RSV, influenza A, parainfluenza, norovirus), day care facilities (influenza A, rotavirus, coronavirus, astrovirus), restaurants, and bars (adenovirus, HAV) (Barker et al. 2001; Boone and Gerba 2005; Goldman 2000; Hota 2004 , Ward et al. 1991 . Presently there are only limited studies investigating HPIV transmission (Ansari et al. 1991; Barker et al. 2001) . Additionally, there appear to be no studies documenting the prevalence of HPIV or other viruses on surfaces in office settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPIV1 on indoor surfaces in an adult setting (office) during an HPIV1 low incident year to better assess the potential role of fomites in its transmission.

Pregnant women have a relatively immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy that could cause them to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population. (3, 4) Pregnant women are more likely to have complications following viral pneumonia and even progress to severe illness. (3, 5) There are some concerns about the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on newborns. (6, 7) Currently, there is no reliable evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to newborn. (4, (8) (9) (10) In mothers with COVID-19, analysis of amniotic fluid, placental tissue, umbilical cord blood and breast milk has shown no trace of SARS-CoV-2. However, this is based on a number of small studies from China in women who developed mild COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy, in which the majority were delivered via caesarean section. (2, 6, 7, 11) It is unknown whether vaginal birth or uterine contraction increases the risk of mother to child transmission. (4, 7, 11) Similarly, the effects of the virus on the foetus in the first and second trimester or in patients with moderate-to-severe infection is unknown. (2, 4, 7) In one study in Wuhan, one newborn tested positive in 36 h of life -there is uncertainty if the newborn acquired the disease postnatally or perinatally. (12) Infection with COVID-19 can range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress in newborns and children, though the evidence is still very limited. (8, 13) Fortunately, children without underlying comorbidities seem to have milder disease.(8) Respiratory distress, vomiting feeds, cough and fever were present in newborns diagnosed with COVID-19.(8) Perinatal COVID-19 infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as foetal distress and premature labour.(6) Close cooperation between obstetric and neonatal departments is encouraged in order to deliver well-prepared and safe resuscitation for newborns in the delivery room. (6) The Neonatal Unit at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital (CMJAH) consists of a 14-bed combined Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PNICU), a 35-bed high-care ward (which offers Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) but not mechanical ventilation), a 40-bed low-care ward (including Kangaroo Mother Care) and a labour ward nursery with 10 beds. The hospital has approximately 9000 births annually and is the referral centre for a number of other regional hospitals, midwife-obstetric units and local clinics. CMJAH has also been identified as one of the hospitals designated for managing COVID-19 cases. (14) As such it is important that all areas in the labour ward, caesarean-section theatre and neonatal unit are adequately prepared. This article discusses the implementation of international and local recommendations as well as any additional actions the Neonatal Unit has undertaken in preparedness for COVID-19.

In cattle the selective transfer of IgG~ from serum to milk continues throughout lactation, although at a reduced level when compared with colostrum formation. The concentration of all three classes ofimmunoglobulin is significantly reduced (30 to 60-fold) in milk and in consequence IgG~ remains the primary immunoglobulin in bovine milk4 ~. In contrasL in pigs the concentration of lgG~ decreases about 30-fold during the first week of lactation, whilst that of secretory lgA declines only about three-fold, leaving it to become the predominant class of immunoglobulin in swine milld t,'8. Most adult cattle are seropositive for both rotavirus 49,s° and coronavirus s~ antibodies. There is a dramatic decline in these colostral antibody titres during the transition to milld 6'49"s~-55, reflecting this reduction in concentration of immunoglobulins. This partially explains the high incidence of rotavirus and coronavirus infections in calves older than five days, as the titres of passively derived protective antibody decline.

The significance and innovation of the present work is that it proposes a sialic acid glycan binding function for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that has been largely neglected by other workers, apparently on the rationale that ACE-2 binding is the important first step in cell entry. Sites involved in the characteristic cap or knob of the spike protein appear partially persuasive in the light of their role as binding to host cells. There is a further possible site towards the base of the external part of the spike protein, which seems less likely by virtue of its position and weaker prediction. Interaction with sialic acid glycan with or without associated catalytic activity would be consistent with such functions observed in many respiratory and alimentary tract viruses, and not least in many or most other coronaviruses, and so such a function must be important to these viruses. On these grounds, it may be a target for therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2, particularly perhaps preventatives as well as means of impeding spread from lung cell to lung cell, and an exposed target for antibodies raised by synthetic vaccines. Although other authors have recently touched on such a glycan binding ability in SARS (as discussed in this paper above and particularly below), it has not been to the present author's knowledge analyzed in comparable detail and do not appear to relate to the same site. Nor do they propose a general prediction method for sialic acid glycan binding as described in the present paper. Of course, in the present paper this is still a prediction and not an experimental result, but it will hopefully encourage experimental researchers to investigate the glycan binding properties of SARS-CoV-2 more extensively. A further innovative feature is that predictive method, which is expected to be worthy of investigation for the proteins of other viruses and even of other organisms. Like many predictive methods in bioinformatics it is not perfect, i.e. there are false positives and false negatives in prediction, so it is actually conceivable that the method is useful even if it is not correct in the particular case of SARS-CoV-2. In that sense, it may emerge as the more important contribution.

The appearance on electron microscopy and genome order of 5 -replicase-structural (spikeenvelope-membrane-nucleocapsid)-polyT-3 on complete genomic sequencing are characteristic of Coronaviridae. Of all the 16 known coronaviruses, this is the only coronavirus affecting human which seems to be phylogenetically distinct from any of the three groups. It is now shown to be distantly related to the group II viruses and currently classified as group IIb. The other human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 belong to antigenic group I (van der Hoek et al, 2004; Fouchier et al, 2004) , whereas human coronavirus OC43 and the newly described HKU1 belongs to group IIa . Group III contains all the avian coronaviruses. Using the relatively rapid mutating surface spike protein as the phylogenetic marker, analysis of 139 SARS-CoV isolates in the Hong Kong outbreak showed that several introductions had occurred, but only one of them was associated the major outbreak in Hong Kong and the rest of the world . Some of the strains found in the beginning of the outbreak were phylogenetically distinct from the major cluster and closer to some of the Guangdong and Beijing strains.

The phenomenon of cross-species spillover is the defining characteristic of pathogens that transmit from vertebrate animals to humans (zoonoses). The public health burden that is presented by zoonoses includes outbreaks of pathogens such as Ebola virus, influenza A virus (H1N1) pdm09 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as the ongoing transmission of endemic pathogens, such as Salmonella spp., Leptospira spp., Trypanosoma spp., Mycobacterium spp. and West Nile virus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Spillover transmission is promoted by successive processes that enable an animal pathogen to establish infection in a human. The probability of zoonotic spillover is determined by interactions among several factors, including disease dynamics in the reservoir host, pathogen exposure and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infections. These factors can be partitioned into three functional phases that describe all major routes of transmission (FIG. 1) . In the first phase, the amount of pathogen available to the human host at a given point in space and time, known as the pathogen pressure, is determined by interactions among reservoir Although many recent articles have examined the fields of zoonoses or emerging pathogens 2,3,10-15 , a synthetic mechanistic understanding of animal-to-human transmission is lacking 14, 16 .

NIAID [14] and CDC [15] also publish lists of pathogens of priority which comprise bacteria and viruses, but categorize these into three groups depending on pathogenicity, accessibility and the availability of vaccines and therapies. All the viruses listed by the WHO also occur on these lists, alongside bacterial pathogens of concern. One of these is Yersinia pestis, causative of bubonic and pneumonic plague, which is recognized by all three bodies (WHO, CDC, NIAID) as a current priority following the exceptionally large and serious outbreak between September 2017 to April 2018 in Madagascar [16] , where the disease is endemic. In addition, NIAID recognizes the added threat to human health posed by the acquisition of AMR by pathogens and WHO has also published a priority list [17] of bacterial species for which R&D is required to develop new antibiotics (Table 2) . Globally, there are many regions of endemic disease which are maintained by reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens in the local wild animal species. These pathogens comprise viral, bacterial and rickettsial species and some have complex lifecycles, infecting an environmental (e.g. standing water) or animal reservoir and then being transmitted either by direct contact with man or indirectly, via an insect (e.g. mosquito) or mammalian (e.g. bat, civet, camel) vector, to man, from which they may be spread by human-tohuman transmission. (Fig. 1 ). An example of a serious and widespread bacterial infection is mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium falciparum, causing malaria in many tropical regions. Malaria causes significant morbidity and co-morbidity in these regions in which it is endemic. Due to the complex life cycle of the causative bacterium, it has been challenging to achieve a vaccine for malaria. The most advanced candidate is the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine [18] , which is undergoing a pilot implementation in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with a view to determining its impact on disease prior to a wider implementation [19] . Despite the availability of approved vaccines [20, 21] , typhoid fever and cholera remain significantly debilitating enteric diseases in regions of the world where hygienic living conditions are poor and there is little access to health care. Both infections are caused by bacteria (Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholera, respectively) which exist in contaminated water and food. Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory infection which is widespread globally. Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and transmitted to man from zoonotic reservoirs (badgers, cattle) with a high potential for subsequent human-to-human transmission, TB is prevalent in susceptible individuals living in overcrowded conditions [22] . Although the BCG vaccine has been in routine use for many years, variable efficacy has been reported, depending on region of use [23, 24] with 60-80% reported in the United Kingdom but lower levels in equatorial countries. The emergence of multi-drugresistant TB (MDR TB) in recent years raises the bar for treatment of this disease and makes a high level of vaccine efficacy even more important [25] . Examples of zoonotic reservoirs which maintain endemic viral diseases are numerous and are summarized in Table 3 . In particular, viral endemic disease is caused by the coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) in Saudi Arabia and the Eastern Mediterranean countries; and by the Lassa arenavirus, which is endemic in West African countries and caused a serious outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria in 2018 [26] ; other viruses which are endemic and cause viral haemorrhagic fever include dengue, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide [27] , the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) which have a zoonotic reservoir in bats in sub-Saharan Africa [28] ; and yellow fever virus, which is prevalent in Africa, Central and South America and the Caribbean [29] . Interestingly, the same mosquito (Aedes aegypti) which spreads yellow fever virus also transmits the dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses [30] . Chikungunya virus has a widespread distribution in Africa, Asia, India and South America and with occasional cases in Europe, and causes a debilitating, but rarely fatal, disease [31] . Zika virus emerged in Brazil in 2015 [32] , although it was first detected in monkeys in Uganda as early as 1947 [33] , and the first documented human case occurred in Nigeria in 1954 [34] . The large Brazilian outbreak of Zika viral disease culminated in 2017, with thousands of cases reported [35] . Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is another zoonotic virus which is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and primarily infects cattle, sheep and goats, but can be transmitted to man by mosquito bite to cause an acute fever [36] . An example of a bacterium which has been classed as a re-emerging pathogen and which is endemic in global regions is Y. pestis, causative of plague. Bubonic [37] [38] [39] . Over thousands of years, Y. pestis has evolved away from the enteric yersinia species to become a lethal flea-transmitted bacterium [40] . It is transmitted to man, typically from a zoonotic reservoir in infected rats or other rodents (e.g. ground squirrels or prairie dogs), by flea-bite to cause bubonic plague [41] (Fig. 2 ). If not detected and treated, this can develop into either septicemic plague or the most serious form of all, a secondary pneumonic plague. In turn, individuals with pneumonic plague can transmit this by aerosol droplet to others, to establish a primary pneumonic plague infection. Each year, a few cases of plague are also reported in the Southwestern United States, where the disease has been endemic in the rodent population since the late 1800s [42] . As well as infecting the rodent population, infected fleas can spread Y. pestis to other wildlife species (e.g. rabbits/hares or, rarely, domesticated animals [43] ) which, in turn, raises the potential of transmission to man by inhalation to cause a primary pneumonic plague. In endemic areas, outbreaks of plague are often associated with seasonal environmental changes, causing rodents to stray closer to human habitation. The plague outbreak in Madagascar during 2017/18 was particularly serious, with an estimated 2671 cases and 239 deaths (8·9% fatality rate) [44] . This outbreak was approximately sixfold greater than usual, with an unusual predominance of pneumonic, rather than bubonic plague.

Although the involvement of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with sialic acid glycans has been rather neglected in the literature (but see below), such involvement represents a prominent and well known feature in the life history of influenza and other viruses, and appears no less important in the life of many other coronaviruses. Admittedly, HIV and many other enveloped viruses do not encode hemagglutinin for sialic acid binding. Instead, they interact using N-terminal sialic acid bound to envelope-associated proteins, like gp120 on HIV-1. However, the mode of infection is different. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cannot jump in a magical way from contaminated surfaces to the lung, and it is doubtful that infective small loads of virus rely on chance to travel from the infecting person to the lung cell ACE2 receptor of the next human host. It is as yet unclear how many virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 are needed for infection, but the virus is clearly very contagious, and this may be because rather few particles are needed for infection.

Any infectious disease outbreak can be broken up into 5 stages: detection, isolation containment, verification, treatment, and eradication. The containment stage is when society has the opportunity to contain the spread of disease and mitigate its progression to an epidemic or pandemic. If containment fails, the disease can spread and, depending on the transmissibility (R0) and death rate of the disease, the results can be catastrophic. On the other hand, a poorly executed quarantine process within the area of containment can also allow further spread of the disease among those being quarantined. Thus, it is important to critically assess the containment and quarantine strategies used on cruise ships during the current COVID-19 outbreak. Quarantine procedures included asking passengers to stay in their rooms, wearing masks, and walking on the deck for only several minutes each day. Some have praised cruise ship containment as being effective in reducing the spread to the mainland, but public health experts have criticized this process as risky to passengers and believe that the ship could create a Petri-dish effect. This could increase the number of confirmed cases among passengers and crew who worked and slept in close quarters. 3, 4 According to the President of World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine, Dr Gregory Ciottone, "These cruise ship quarantines as currently being implemented should change. Due to the sequential exposure/infection rate (ventilation system) there is no definitive end-time, and all onboard will only be disembarked either after infected, or when they may be in an asymptomatic incubation period." 5 Methods to improve quarantine on cruise ships include dividing the cruise ship passengers into 3 groups. The first group of symptomatic patients who test positive for the virus would be taken off the ship and be transported to a medical facility where they can be placed under strict isolation and undergo treatment. This isolation may include negative pressure rooms for patients and the necessary PPE for healthcare workers involved in their care, such as, N-95 masks, gloves, and gowns. Remaining passengers on the ship who are not symptomatic should be tested for the virus to determine who should go in the second and third groups. Those who test positive but are asymptomatic should be taken off the ship and placed in a temporary medical tent. This would need to contain isolation rooms for each passenger where they would be monitored for progression or regression of their condition. The third group would consist of those who test negative. This group would be under strict quarantine for 14 days, as they may have been exposed to the virus, to observe for signs of developing infection. Placing the passengers into these 3 groups would help reduce the spread of the virus from passengers in group 2 to those in group 3, and thus ensure that infected passengers get the care they need without forcing others to be continually exposed.

Findings from researchers reveal that photon transportation is mainly responsible for graphene's thermal conductive behavior, which is ten times greater than copper. [57b,66] Ballistic conduction and diffusive conduction are responsible for thermal conductivity of graphene in low temperature and high temperature condition respectively. [67] Phonon scattering and localization originated by imperfections of graphene is responsible for the inherent thermal conductivity of graphene. [67, 68] It is reported that there are differences in in-plane and out of plane conductivity, which is due to sp 2 covalent bonding and van der Waals bond, respectively. [69] In normal temperature and free state, the www.advmatinterfaces.de in-plane thermal conductivity varies from 2000 to 4000 W m −1 K −1 , which is maximum among our any known materials. [69, 70] However, graphene's thermal conductivity can be fallen in contact with substrates. [71] Because of superior joule heating, thermal conductivity of graphene spreads heat and generates thermal transmission for passive cooling. This property can transmit heat from the human body to the environment. [72]

Organ cultures refer to the thin slices of organs preserved in vitro which allow diffusion of nutritional substances or perfused organs. Cells in organ cultures can maintain their high degree of differentiation and specialized functions for some Identification and propagation of viruses in tissue and cell cultures 39 weeks. The restricted length of life and in particular the difficulties involved in identifying viral changes have led to this type of culture being used only in selected cases. Epithelium from the respiratory and the intestinal tract and fragments from nervous tissue, ovaries, thyroidea, are examples of differentiated tissues that can be maintained in organ cultures. Organ cultures with ciliated respiratory epithelium are used for the cultivation of respiratory viruses (e.g. coronaviruses and certain rhinoviruses), which do not grow in cell cultures (cf. Chapter 20) . The cells from a primary culture can be increased in number by 'passaging', which means that the cells are transferred from one cultivation vessel to another, where they again are allowed to form a monolayer. The cells are suspended mechanically or by the use of proteolytic enzymes and/or chelate-forming agents, for example EDTA. The latter compound can bind Ca++ which is needed for the anchorage of cells to the supporting layer. After distribution of the suspension of cells into three or four new cultivation vessels, cells again attach themselves to the bottom of the vessels and divide until the supporting surface is covered with a layer of cells. Passage of primary cell cultures can be made within one to four weeks after their establishment. With repeated passaging a certain kind of cell eventually becomes dominant.

However, some questions remain unanswered. Most of the cases in the studies as described above had mild to moderate symptoms, and all manifested during the third trimester of pregnancy, and therefore the time interval from clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection to delivery was short. Since the placental barrier may temporarily delay the transfer of the virus from the mother to the fetus, as observed in cytomegalovirus infection, it is uncertain whether there could be a risk of vertical transmission when the COVID-19 infection occurs in the first or second trimester, or when there is a long clinical manifestation-to-delivery interval.

S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new disease caused by a novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1, 2 It is characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath 3 and is fatal in about 10% of cases. 4 The virus is thought to be transmitted from person to person, primarily through large respiratory droplets. 5 The fi rst SARS cases appeared in Southern China in November 2002. 6 By July 2003, when the outbreak was considered over, 8,096 probable cases, including 774 deaths, had been reported from 29 countries. 4 In the United States, 72 probable cases were identifi ed, only 8 of which were laboratory confi rmed as SARS-CoV infections. 6 Public concern that the environment in aircraft cabins could enhance SARS-CoV transmission may have contributed to decreased air travel during the outbreak. 7 Although several reports have been published on possible SARS-CoV transmission aboard aircraft, 8 -11 the risk of transmission remains unclear.

Most emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, the pathogens of which are transmitted between humans and animals.

Recently, cases of influenza A virus H7N9 transmitted from birds to humans have been reported [2] . The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak originated from the transmission of a novel bat coronavirus [3] . For the sporadically endemic Ebola virus, bats are suspected to be the natural reservoir, but this is still controversial [4] . Vector-borne zoonoses caused by transmission of viruses through mosquitoes and ticks have also become a public health concern. The 1999 outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) that occurred in New York was caused by the transmission of the WNV among birds, horses and humans via mosquitoes [5] . Similarly, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was found to be due to a virus transmitted by ticks [6] .

We consider here the pandemic infection that occurs when the virus is transmitted to the human body from the intermediate host and continues to spread from human-to-human. The first three equations on the system show an SI (susceptible-infected) model to explain the transmission from human-to-human, where S is the susceptible class, C1 is the infected class, which does not know that they are infected because of the late occurred symptoms of COVID-19 and C2 represents the infected class that knows they are infected. The spillover from the intermediate infected class M to the human host S denotes a predator-prey mathematical model, while for the transmission from the natural host N, which is the bat population, to intermediate host M is a host-parasite model of Holling Type II. Thus, the mathematical model of this biological phenomena is modeled as follows;(1){dSdt=S(t)r1(p−α1S(t))−β1C1([[t]])S(t)−β2M([[t]])S(t)+σ1M([[t]])S(t)dC1dt=C1(t)r2(1−α2C1(t))+β1(1−ε1)S([[t]])C1(t)−θC1([[t]])C1(t)+β2(1−ε2)M([[t]])C1(t)dC2dt=C2(t)(1−α3C2(t)+θC1([[t]])+β1ε1S([[t]])+β2ε2M([[t]]))dMdt=M(t)r3(1−α4M(t))−σ2M(t)−γf(t)N([[t]])dNdt=N(t)r4(1−α5N(t))+δg([[t]])N(t)where(2)f(t)=M(t)1+heωM(t)andg(t)=M(t)1+heωM(t)represent the Holling type II functions.

In the context of viral entry, Berend Jan Bosch and colleagues focus on the viral receptors for Coronaviruses. Two highly pathogenic Coronaviruses have emerged in the last decade, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly discovered Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (8) . This is in addition to known human coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms (ex. hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43) and economically important porcine coronaviruses (ex. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV). Interestingly, 4 of the 6 human Coronaviruses have evolved to utilize endopeptidases expressed on either the respiratory or intestinal tract, including MERS-CoV. Jan Bosch points out the nature of this interaction and how the moderately conserved nature of each endopeptidase between species could allow for viral spillover from one host species to the next. As SARS-CoV, the ACE2 receptor on host cells is expressed in palm civets and bats, and a recent finding of a SARS-like bat virus capable of using human ACE2 for entry demonstrates the ability of Coronaviruses to jump from one species to another. The ability of Coronaviruses to spread from one species to the other has occurred throughout recent history. The porcine coronavirus, Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) evolved from the Canine Coronavirus with prominent Spike mutations allowing for the species shift from dog to cow(9). Variants of the normally self-limiting canine coronavirus have also arisen that confer high mortality rates in dogs, with mutations found in the Spike protein (10) . This leads us to hypothesize that the direct interaction between viral Spike protein and receptor is even more than just for binding of the virion to the cell. Further research on the effect of how Coronavirus:receptor interactions affect pathogenesis are needed to understand this intimate and critical association.

In December 2019, an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which is now officially named as coronavirus disease by the WHO [1] [2] [3] . The disease has spread rapidly from Wuhan to other regions in China. As of March 17, 2020, a total of 80,881 COVID-19-confirmed cases were reported in China [4] . Internationally, confirmed cases have been reported in >150 countries and regions around the world at present [5] . On January 3, 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified in a bronchial alveolar lavage fluid sample from a patient in Wuhan and confirmed to be the cause of COVID-19 [6] . Whole genome sequencing and systematic analysis showed that this novel coronavirus is a distinct clade from beta coronavirus associated with human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome [6] , which was officially named "SARS-CoV-2" by WHO now. Although the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated, current evidence suggests it was transmitted to humans through the spread of wild animals illegally sold in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market [7] . Case reports have confirmed the interpersonal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [8] . Currently, there are no specific treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. Huang et al. [9] first reported 41 COVID-19 cases, most of whom had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The patient's clinical manifestations included fever, unproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, normal or decreased white blood cell count, and imaging evidence of pneumonia [9] . Wang et al. [10] reported in 138 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed cases, presumed hospital-related transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality was 4.3%. In this study, the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed, and the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function were explored.

At the other end of the scale are unintentional 'mass gatherings' such as refugees taking shelter in huge camps, often in cramped conditions with poor hygiene. These are not usually regarded as mass gathering events, but nevertheless they pose the same problem in terms of the transmission of pathogens in the situation of a large number of people in a limited space. Currently the civil war in Syria has displaced many people, and diseases like tuberculosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, measles, and polio are a risk. 1 Such conditions also increase the risk of transmission of zoonoses, with expected closer contact to rodents compared to normal conditions. Thus a One Health approach is also needed in this situation. 2 Mass gathering events are theoretically ideal situations for the spread of infections between people from very different and widespread geographical localities, with potentially different immune responses. One of the first events that focused the international health community on mass gathering events was the outbreak of meningitis in 2000-2001 after the Hajj. 3, 4 However, the spread of infections is rarely caused by mass gathering sports events. 5 All previous experiences from different mass gathering show that vaccine preventable diseases is the most important infections like influenza, hepatitis A, polio and meningitis. Three mass gathering held in Africa during the Ebola outbreak accepted participants from West Africa and was able to handle the theoretical risk without any incident. Therefore we believe that the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro should not be cancelled. The number of visitors to the games is a tiny fraction (1%) of other visitors to Zika endemic countries and it will have no measurable effect on the risk of spreading Zika virus, if the games was cancelled. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from China to Hong Kong and further to Canada was not due to a mass gathering, but to infected individuals travelling late in the incubation period or just after the onset of symptoms. 6, 7 The introduction of West Nile virus to North America was probably through wild birds crossing the Atlantic, and it could not have been predicted. Lastly, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korea was caused by a single traveller waiting in an overcrowded hospital emergency room in South Korea. 8 The Korean MERS-CoV outbreak illustrates how difficult it is to predict the future. MERS was estimated to have a low epidemic potential, 9 and it was pointed out in this Journal that the outbreak was identified as being caused by MERS-CoV because it happened in a country with the resources (knowledge and laboratory facilities) to rapidly identify the virus. 10

Currently, COVID-19 appears to spread from human to human through the uniform process as usual cold or flu viruses, i.e., face interaction with a sneeze, or from interaction with secretions of humans who are diseased. The function of fecal oral interaction is however, to be resolved in COVID-19 although it was found to appear through the SARS epidemic (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004). The isolation of Wuhan City looks to have reduced the worldwide extent of COVID-19, yet the consequence is anticipated to be ephemeral. To date, enormous people are affected globally in COVID-19 and many of them are recovering but a number of demises become cumulative in time as shown in Fig. 5 . Attempts are presently proceeding in China, almost 190 nations to which diseased persons have toured, and in communal transportations, for instance, voyage ships, to disrupt communication of all present and possible chains of transmission, through eradication of COVID-19 in humanoid inhabitants as the conclusive goal. Though the number of global active cases is inclining with time, for instance, the number of actives cases in Iran on March 29, 2020 was 39, 875 but after 1 day on March 30, 2020, the number increases to 41,495 (Coronavirus Cases, 2020) . In Turkey, the number was 10,827 on March 29, 2020 and later it was 13, 531 on March 30, 2020 (Coronavirus Cases, 2020) . Similar active case can be found for Russia, South Korea, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and other Asian country. The growth factor for active cases is surging for all Asian countries as illustrated in Fig. 6 , though China has taken several strict verdicts to put a chain on COVID-19 and seems they are attaining some sound effect (Homeland Security Today News, 2020).

Avian flu H5N1 virus causes outbreaks of serious disease in poultry and wild birds in countries around the world. Although it is not easily transmitted to humans, more than 500 human cases have been reported since 2003 in parts of Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, with a case mortality rate of about 60%. Transmission of avian flu H5N1to humans usually involves direct contact with infected birds, but if the virus mutates and becomes more easily spread from human to human (e.g., airborne by the respiratory route), this could start an influenza pandemic or worldwide outbreak of disease. Avian influenza H7N9 virus continues to cause severe outbreaks of disease on poultry farms in China, in other Asian countries, and in the US. So far, human cases reported from Asia have not led to sustained human-to-human transmission. Considering the possibility of an avian flu pandemic in the future, IATA in cooperation with the CDC developed guidelines for airline personnel meeting passengers arriving from known outbreak areas, as well as for airline cleaning and maintenance crews who may potentially be exposed. All guidelines emphasize basic hygiene practices to prevent becoming ill, such as hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand gel, separation of any ill passengers and providing them with a surgical mask or tissues to cover the mouth and nose, use of disposable gloves when handling blood or body fluids, and prompt reporting of the illness to public health authorities. Specialized personal protective equipment such as respirators or gowns is not recommended except in direct patient-care situations, although the use of surgical masks when around symptomatic individuals in public areas may be considered. Specialized passenger screening techniques such as thermal screening to identify febrile passengers when pre-boarding that were utilized during the SARS epidemic in some international locations are not being recommended at this time.

The material internalized into the cells within endosomal vesicles is outside of the cytoplasm, thus still virtually resident in the extracellular environment. Therefore, efficient gene delivery requires the nucleic acids to pass through a biological membrane bilayer, either by destruction of the membrane itself or by physical passage. In this respect, nature has evolved different mechanisms allowing entry into the cytoplasm of macromolecules contained inside the various vesicle compartments, which are variously exploited by a number of cell pathogens to enter the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In particular, viruses and toxins essentially use two main pathways to gain access to the cytosol: they can either be transferred from early or late endosomes into the cytosol in response to low pH, or enter the Golgi and then the ER and be transferred to the cytosol from this destination. An example of the first mechanism is offered by the diphtheria toxin, for which the relatively low pH found in endosomes triggers a conformational change in the toxin that drives formation of a membrane pore allowing its direct entry into the cytosol. Other molecules instead reach the Golgi apparatus and the ER following a route in reverse of the classic secretory pathway. These molecules include plant toxins, such as ricin, and bacterial toxins, such as Shiga toxin, part of cholera toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A; these often consist of two chains or domains, one responsible for cellular internalization and trafficking, and the other one exerting the biological effect proper of the toxin. Classical secretion is characterized by transport of newly synthesized proteins from the ER to the Golgi, followed by budding of vesiculated cargos from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), vesicle sorting in the cytoplasm, and eventual vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Toxin cell entry is enabled by binding to a cell surface molecule, followed by endocytosis. Once in the early or late endosomes, toxins escape lysosomal degradation by re-routing the vesicles toward the TGN and, from this, to the ER, either directly or through the Golgi apparatus. Once toxins have reached the ER, the cytoplasm is accessed by taking advantage of the ER protein auditing system known as ERAD (ER-associated protein degradation). This mechanism eliminates misfolded proteins from the ER by discarding them into the cytoplasm through a pore known as the Sec61 translocon, which is actually also used by several of the toxins. Finally, certain mammalian viruses, such as polyomaviruses, influenza viruses, coronaviruses, and echoviruses, and some toxins, such as cholera toxin, use caveolae-mediated transport from the cell surface to reach the ER. This has been particularly studied for the simian virus 40 (SV40), which is internalized from lipid rafts and, through caveosomes, is eventually released into the ER, from which it escapes to the cytoplasm and gains access to the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex.

For traumatic patients, the domestic accident was the main cause of trauma, in contrast with the literature which the most frequent causes are represented by road accident, followed by sports injuries, although it is difficult to establish due to the limited number of cases. 2, 3 The reason could be due to the severe restrictions applied during this epidemic period, including the prohibition on traveling from one municipality to another with your or public means, except for work needs, absolute urgency or health reasons. Considering that the COVID-19 virus is a new type and its biological behaviour and the treatment of the pneumonia caused by it are still in the research phase and to date there is no clear specific therapeutic drug, in the treatment of maxillofacial diseases, the prevention is the best way to reduce the risk of spreading the epidemic caused by medical activities. For this reason, it was important to share the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway with the Unit of Anesthesia and Resuscitation and Service Medicine.

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates influenza's overall case fatality rate at around 0.1%. 10 Furthermore, it is estimated that each case of COVID-19 will infect an average of between 2 and 2.5 other people. 6 This ratio is referred to as the reproductive number. A literature review found the reproductive number of seasonal influenza to be lower, at 1.19 and 1.37. 11 The emergence of a contagious disease with a higher reproductive number and 10-40 times more lethal than seasonal influenza should concern all of us. Understanding how the disease is spread is paramount to mitigate its spread. As with many coronaviruses, evidence indicates that COVID-19 is spread via respiratory droplets. 4, 8, 12 can travel directly from an infected person to a nearby person after coughing or sneezing. It has been collected on the surfaces of a patient's hospital room after hours to days. 13 The same study established that using standard cleaning agents eliminated the virus from surfaces.

While H5N1 and SARS are both respiratory tract infections transmitted by air, their transmissions and infections are different. H5N1 belongs to a group of avian influenzas, which can typically emerge in either low-or high-pathogenic forms. 3 H5N1 is designated as highly infectious. SARS is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses in general cause "mild to moderate upperrespiratory tract illnesses." 4 SARS, however, is not typical. It, also, is highly infectious. Neither, as of yet, is particularly effective in transmitting itself from person to person. 5 Tuberculosis, by contrast, is. If and when either does become so efficient and effective, a global pandemic is almost certain. Here it is worth noting that risk-of eventual human-to-human transmission, or an airborne mutation-is not the same thing as the existent threat of the same as is.

Recent publications have shed light on various issues surrounding feral cats, including the demographics of the cats and their caretakers and the effects of Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) programs on the overall population (Levy et al., 2003; Scott et al., 2002) . The purpose of this study was to extend this information database and determine the prevalence and risk factors of infectious diseases in a population of feral cats. The term ''feral'' used in this study includes free-roaming stray and feral cats and implies a lack of confinement and ownership. The infectious organisms studied here were chosen because of their importance to feline or human health. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline coronavirus (FCoV) are organisms that spread directly from cat to cat; feral cats could serve as a source of infection to pet cats allowed outdoors or other freeroaming cats. Dirofilariaimmitis (mosquitoes), Mycoplasma haemofelis (Ctenocephalides felis), M. haemominutum (C. felis suspected), Bartonella henselae (C. felis), Ehrlichia spp. (tick suspected), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ixodes spp.) are infectious agents that cause clinical disease in some cats and are proven or suspected to be vector-borne. In addition, some Ehrlichia spp. and A. phagocytophilum can also infect human beings. Feral cats may play a role in spread of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in the environment, indirectly resulting in the infection of a variety of species including domestic cats and human beings. Bartonella henselae is a flea-borne zoonotic agent that occasionally causes clinical illness in cats; feral cats may play a role in magnifying the organism in C. felis that then infest pet cats and human beings.

The outbreak of the novel virus among humans was first reported in April 2012, when eight healthcare workers from one intensive care unit in Jordan had respiratory illness; however, the source was unknown at that time [11] . In June 2012, a 60-year-old man presented in Saudi Arabia with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure, which eventually led to his death. A previously unknown coronavirus was detected in his sputum and provisionally called human coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC) [1] . Shortly thereafter, in September 2012, the same virus was detected in a patient with severe respiratory illness who had been transferred from the Middle East to the United Kingdom. Combining with retrospective analysis of stored samples from the aforementioned outbreak in Jordan, the novel virus, renamed MERS-CoV, was recognized as the cause of a new severe respiratory disease [12] .

Like SARS, the origin host for MERS-CoV is the bat but the transmitting animal is typically the dromedary camel. The virus has infected 1728 people, since its emergence, and has had a 35.6% mortality rate since August of 2016. 7 Recently, in December of last year, coronavirus re-emerged, once again from China, with the initial outbreak in Wuhan, a city located in the country's Hubei Province. It has since been designated as SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting disease is called COVID-2019 8 . Close to 300,000 cases, globally, have been reported, since its outbreak. The point of origin is considered to be a seafood/animal market in Wuhan which houses and sells, not only fish, but exotic animals including hedgehogs, badgers, snakes, and birds (turtledoves). 8, 9 This new virus, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, is also a beta subtype and its exact animal host/reservoir has yet to be determined. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that environmental samples taken from the marketplace came back positive for COVID-2019. Its similarity to SARS is found in the predominant human receptor for the SARS S glycoprotein, human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found primarily in the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper airway. 3 This may be a partial explanation for the severe respiratory symptoms and consequences of both diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). When cases were being confirmed in people who had not visited the Wuhan seafood market or been in its proximity, suspicions arose that the virus was being transmitted from person to person. 10 A study published by the New England Journal of Medicine of the first 435 patients that were infected with the new virus, in Wuhan, found that the median age was 59 years old (range of 15-89 yrs.), 56% were male, and that no children < 15yrs had contracted the disease. 11 Since this study, however, a retrospective study at Wuhan University that was published in JAMA has reported that 9 infants had contracted COVID-2019 ranging in age from 1-11mos. of which seven were female. 12 The first confirmed U.S. case of COVID-2019 was diagnosed in the state of Washington, on January 30, 2020, resulting from person to person contact, and was it determined to be caused through international travel to Wuhan, China. 13 This, also, is the date the rapidly spreading virus was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the International Health Regulations (IHR) emergency committee of the WHO. PHEIC is defined by the WHO as "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease; and to potentially require a coordinated international response." This definition implies a situation that: "is serious, unusual, or unexpected; carries implications for public health beyond the affected State's national border;

COVID-19 is a highly contagious, potentially lethal disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, especially in older patients. COVID-19 patients from non-designated hospitals, isolation sites, or fever clinics should be transferred to designated hospitals for further treatment. Critically ill patients should be transferred from general wards to ICU for critical care. COVID-19 patients should also undergo a CT scan, which requires them to move from one department to another. Thus, adequate preparation should be made to ensure the safety of patients and transport staff, as well as public health before, during, and after transportation.

Years before germ theory, humans knew that some diseases were transmissible from human to human. Syphilis is generally believed to have come originally from the New World, imported into Europe by Christopher Columbus's sailors after their famous voyage in 1492, and the sexual nature of syphilis transmission and its contagiousness was noticed from the beginning. The contagiousness of leprosy, cholera, and plague was immediately recognized from as early as 1377, when the rector of the seaport of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) made mandatory for the first time a trentina (30-day isolation period) for ships coming from areas suspected of plague [2] . Furthermore, sick patients were cared for in places established outside the city walls [3] . Soon after in 1423, Venice set up the first lazaretto, a quarantine station (with a 40-day isolation period) dedicated to people coming from infected areas, which became a model for European countries, especially in Marseille [3] . The discovery of germ theory [4] , the availability of diagnostic microbiology laboratories, the availability of vaccines, and the discovery of antibiotics led physicians and hospital policy makers to lose their interest in classic transmissible infectious diseases, believing that they had won the war against germs. Unfortunately, in the early 20th century, hospital-acquired infections and increased antibiotic resistance [5] were quickly followed by worldwide outbreaks of viral diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and viral hemorrhagic fevers; microbiology laboratory accidents; and hospital-acquired outbreaks of Clostridium difficile colitis [6] . The revived infection controls in hospitals and microbiology laboratories led to new questions and new scientific knowledge. Laboratory biosecurity rules were made mandatory and infection control in hospitals was reinforced with emphasis on preparedness to future threats. Single bedrooms were shown as a means to avoid influenza transmission in hospitals [7] , whereas hand hygiene [8] and catheter control have been proven efficient in the fight of frequent hospital-acquired infection [9, 10] . Fast microbiological identification [11] , such as diagnosis at the point of care (POC), has also been reported as an efficient means to control contagion [12] ; in addition, microbiologic and epidemiological surveys should help to anticipate sanitary crises. The SARS lessons lead to the revival of patient biocontainment, suggesting the creation of high-level isolation units (HLIUs) across the word [13, 14] and updating healthcare protocols for secure care of very highly contagious patients [15] , which have been proven efficient in the care of Ebola virus disease in Europe and the United States [16] .

We have divided the virus infections into two categories, those that are transmitted to humans directly from vertebrate animals (like rodents, foxes, bats and birds) and those that are primarily transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies). The latter class is formed by arboviruses but notably they have vertebrate hosts in nature.

The COVID-19 disease that has rapidly spread from the Chinese Wuhan city to the rest of the world is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) named also the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1 The sequencing of its genome revealed that it is closely related to other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have killed hundreds of people in the last two decades. 2, 3 Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that carry on their surface spike-like projections giving it a crown-like appearance under the electron microscope; hence the name coronavirus. 4 These spikes (S) enable the fusion between viral and host membranes and are essential for the beginning of the enveloped virus infection. 5, 6 They are composed of a large ectodomain, a trans-membrane anchor and a short intracellular tail ( Fig. 1) . The ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2 which are crucial for binding of the virus to the host cell surface and for entry of the viral genomes into the target cell, respectively. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The S1 subunit is composed of N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), which can both function as the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), recognizing and binding to the host protein receptor. The cellular entry receptor for the SARS-CoV is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). 12 The RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share significant sequence similarity, therefore several research groups investigated if SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cellular entry receptor. 2, [13] [14] [15] [16] And they all confirmed that this is indeed the case.

(FECV) is endemic in the cat population and causes mostly asymptomatic infections. In young kittens, it can cause mild gastrointestinal infections (Pedersen et al., 1981) . The highly pathogenic feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) manifests in a progressive and mostly fatal disease, FIP, characterized by granulomatous lesions (Pedersen et al., 2009) . The most prominent factor that determines the difference between the two pathotypes is the ability to establish an efficient and productive infection in monocytes/macrophages (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Rottier et al., 2005) . The low virulent FECV mainly infects enterocytes but can also enter and replicate in monocytes (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Meli et al., 2004) . However, it was shown in vitro that after one replication cycle, the percentage of FECV infected monocytes decreases (Dewerchin et al., 2005) . This is probably the reason why only low viral loads of FECV can be found systemically and infection does not lead to FIP. In contrast, the highly pathogenic counterpart, FIPV, has the ability to productively infect monocytes and this sustained infection is probably the basis for the development of FIP (Kipar et al., 2006) . RNA viruses, such as FCoVs, generally have very high mutation rates compared to DNA viruses, because viral RNA polymerases lack proof-reading. This, together with the close genetic similarity of FECV to FIPV and the low incidence of FIP, despite the high prevalence of FCoV seropositive cats, led to the widespread acceptance of the ''internal mutation theory''. Numerous publications supported that FIPV, unlike FECV, is not transmitted from cat to cat but arises from FECV by mutation within an individual cat (Chang et al., 2010; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Pedersen et al., 2012; Rottier et al., 2005; Vennema et al., 1998) . Up till now, it is not yet completely clarified what these FIP-inducing mutations in FECV might be. The C-terminal domain of the FIPV spike protein has already been shown to be important for efficient macrophage infection (Chang et al., 2012; Rottier et al., 2005) . In addition, accessory proteins have been proposed to be potential targets for mutations and as such important for virulence. These accessory proteins are species-specific and are dispensable for in vitro replication. During passaging of CoVs in cell cultures, viral mutants with deletions in accessory ORFs arise spontaneously and show growth advantages (Lorusso et al., 2008) , suggesting that loss of accessory gene expression increases viral fitness in vitro. Despite their redundancy in vitro, deletion of accessory ORF clusters from FIPV 79-1146, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome resulted in attenuated viruses (de Haan et al., 2002; Haijema et al., 2004; Ortego et al., 2003) . Thus, these proteins are of key importance for virus-host interactions and critically contribute to viral virulence and pathogenesis. Nevertheless, a clear function could not be attributed so far to any of the accessory proteins of FCoVs.

In late 2002, an outbreak of unusual life-threatening respiratory disease of unknown etiology began in Guangdong Province, China. This disease was designated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and was later determined by Drosten et al. (2003) , Ksiazek et al. (2003) , and Rota et al. (2003) , to be caused by a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV. Since the identification of coronavirus as the infectious agent for SARS, numerous laboratories have begun research on this virus. According to the WHO, 8098 people were diagnosed with SARS and 774 people died of this disease during the initial outbreak of 2003. Due to the severity of SARS disease and the contagious nature of the causal agent, the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003 12 18/en/) has provided guidelines for working safely with this coronavirus. The WHO recommends biosafety level 3 (BSL3) as the appropriate containment level for working with live SARS-CoV, and there is a concern that another SARS outbreak could occur following an accidental exposure in a laboratory. Since the end of the SARS epidemic in July 2003, there have been three known cases of SARS in laboratory researchers due to accidental exposure to the virus (Normile, 2004) . Successful inactivation of the virus allows the transfer of material from a BSL3 to a BSL2 environment and may reduce the risk of accidental infections through unsafe laboratory practices. Inactivated cell-culture derived viral stocks may also be useful for the development of vaccines and the study of their safety and immunogenicity. We examined the efficiency of several methods of viral inactivation, including methods that may inhibit viral replication or entry.

The disease, which initially spread from animal to human, later spread from person to person, causing a pandemic. Viral disease (COVID-19) can present in a variety of forms, from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic with severe, respiratory failure, requiring intensive care. The care of the latter group of patients places a significant burden on health care. The purpose of this summary is to present the practical aspects of caring for patients requiring intensive care and respiratory support / mechanical ventilation. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161 (17): 678-684.

Like other similar virus, recent updates show that the SARS-CoV-2 now spread from man to man, although it is presumed to be zoonotic in origin. While the genetic research confirmed SARS-CoV-2 is originated in bats, there are other speculations that other wild animals could serve as intermediary between bats and man, with pangolins leading as primary suspects as the intermediary in the case of Wuhan coronavirus (Liu et al., 2019) . SARS-CoV-2 spread like other cold viruses and early symptoms include, but not limited to, runny nose, severe cough, sore throat, difficulty in breathing, etc. With several precautions and awareness on the deadly virus and its spread, more cases of infection are being anticipated globally. The known cases are being managed with supplemental oxygen and conservative fluid administration as there is currently no approved vaccine or antiviral agent to treat the infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the concerned researchers are continuously working on developing a vaccine or drug for novel coronavirus (Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019) .

A 53-years-old alcoholic male was transferred to our intensive care unit from a private hospital in Egypt on October 18, 2015 in a state of confusion, disturbed conscious level and diffuse abdominal pain. He was diagnosed as acute pancreatitis with multiple organ failure. He presented with severe sepsis secondary to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was intubated in septic shock and required inotropes. During transfer, the patient had one attack of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. He was immediately started on Keppra (500 mg BID). The patient was sedated, hemodynamically unstable and unconscious (coma scale: 6/15) (BP 134/68 mm HG) (hyperthermia 39 • C) (tachycardia 127 beats/min). Laboratory investigation showed: hemoglobin 12.7 g/L, WBCs 18 109/L, platelets 332 109/L, albumin 25 g/L, creatinine 160 mcmol/L, Troponin-I 0.37 mcg/L. He was started empirically on tazocin. During his stay in the ICU, he had spikes of high temperature (40 • C). Blood culture grew gram negative bacilli which was identified as K. pneumonia (CRKP, MDRO), resistant to Tazocin, Imipenem and Ciprofloxacin and sensitive to Meropenem and Amikacin. Tazocin was suspended and Meropenem combined with Amikacin were started. Sputum culture grew Acinetobacter spp. (MDRO), sensitive to Colistin. The patient was screened for MERS CoV and H1N1, which were negative but he was still symptomatic, and the infection control team recommended continuing airborne and contact isolation. The patient condition became worse, as he had aspiration pneumonia post seizure attack. He also developed new infiltration on CXR with more requirements for inotropic support. He was started on Colistin, Vancomycin and Caspofungen and continued on Meropenem and Amikacin. The patient became in a critical condition; he was in a refractory septic shock in spite of good coverage with many broad spectrum antibiotics. He deteriorated rapidly and died on November 7, 2015. Gene expert analysis revealed K. pneumonia isolate from the blood culture as carbapenemase producer (OXA-48+).

After 2019-nCoV was confirmed as being capable of transmitting from human to human, the Chinese government implemented top to bottom national mobilisation. It fully investigated and isolated the population of Wuhan, and also publicised the severity of the epidemic, and also increased awareness of the prevention of infectious diseases and raised people's vigilance through messages on television, mobile communications and the Internet. In addition, according to the latest epidemic surveillance, the incubation period of the coronavirus is 3 to 7 days, with an upper limit of 14 days. For this reason, the central government has issued an executive order to extend the Spring Festival holiday from 30 January to 2 February 2020. Many provinces are even requiring firms to not restart work until 9 February, except those necessary for social operations related to the national economy and people's livelihood. Extending the holiday is needed to avoid the returning people leaving home early and returning to work, so as to minimise the risk of the epidemic spreading again due to population fluctuations.

The most prominent recent example of an emerging virus was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus. In November 2002, the first known case of atypical pneumonia occurred in Foshan City (Guangdong Province, China). Until March 2003, the "severe atypical pneumonia" spread over three continents (13 countries). Then, the World Health Organization (WHO) set up global networks to expedite detection of the causative agent; develop a robust and reliable diagnostic test; pool clinical knowledge on symptoms, diagnosis, and management; and study SARS epidemiology. Schools were closed, thousands of people were put under quarantine in affected areas, travel recommendations were issued, and airlines started screening their passengers for symptoms. Exactly 1 mo after its establishment, the WHO laboratory network announced conclusive identification of the SARS causative agent: an entirely new coronavirus, unlike any other human or animal member of the family Coronaviridae. In July 2003, the last known chain of transmission was interrupted in Taiwan. The coordinated control measures recommended by WHO, which included early identification and isolation of patients, vigorous contact tracing, management of close contacts, and public information and education to encourage prompt reporting of symptomscertainly together with a portion of luck-were effective to overcome the SARS epidemic. An example of a reemerging virus is West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States. Within 4 yr WNV spread from the East Coast to the West Coast. Birds are the primary amplifying hosts, and the virus is maintained in a birdmosquito-bird cycle. Infection of mammals is a dead-end infection. The reason for the rapid dynamics of the WNV epidemics in North America is that the virus found a favorable environment with the appropriate vectors and naïve hosts.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, singlestranded RNA viruses which included in three different antigenic groups. CoVs infecting dogs comprise canine enteric coronavirus (CCoV) (Enjuanes et al., 2000) and www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Veterinary Microbiology 128 (2008) [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] [260] the newly recognised canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Erles et al., 2003; Decaro et al., 2007a) , belonging to group 1 and group 2 CoVs, respectively. Two CCoV genotypes have been identified so far, namely CCoV type I and CCoV type II, which are responsible for the occurrence enteritis in dogs and are frequently associated in mixed infections Decaro et al., 2005c) . Although its tropism is restricted to the gastroenteric tract, CCoV has been recently associated to systemic disease followed by fatal outcome in pups . Severe clinical signs were observed in the affected pups, whereas necropsy examination revealed remarkable gross lesions in lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys. Virological and bacteriological investigations failed to detect common canine pathogens. Unexpectedly, CCoV type II RNA was detected at very high titres in the internal organs of the dead pups and the virus (strain CB/05) was isolated on canine cell cultures. The association of strain CB/05 to a severe, sometimes fatal disease of dogs, together with the isolation of the virus from organs with severe lesions, strongly suggests that CCoV has changed its tropism, acquiring the ability to spread from the enteric tract to the internal organs (Decaro et al., 2007b) .

The coronavirus Covid-2019 infection is rapidly transmitted, the disease is still in its spreading phase with predictions of infection expand to over one people globally. We have derived the estimates of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic and found that still the mean growth factor for number of cases and mortality rate is more than 1.0. It is highly contagious because of its biological characteristics (Meo et al., 2020) . It is a zoonotic disease with person-to-person transmission through droplet or contact transmission (Wu et al., 2019) . Infected people can transmit the disease before they present clinical symptoms (Rothe et al., 2020) . This is the main reason that the disease could swiftly spread from Wuhan, China to various corners of the globe. More recently, the epicenter of the diseases appears to have shifted from Wuhan, China to the European world and mainly Italy, and United States of America (World Health Organization, 2020). Many countries including China, Italy, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Poland, Ireland, Denmark, Spain, France have cancelled international flights and implemented the world's largest and most restrictive quarantines policies to minimize the further transmission and disease burden. For the prevention of the spread of the disease, these countries are not permitting people to enter or leave the country without strict screening of the passenger for Covid-2019 infection at airports. (Quilty et al., (2020) evaluated the usefulness of thermal passenger screening for COVID-19 infection at airports exit and entry points. The authors found that effectiveness of entry screening was dependent on the effectiveness of the exit screening at the destination. The authors identified that 46% of the infected travelers were not detected, because of the incubation period, and asymptomatic or subclinical cases (Chan et al., 2020) . (Quilty et al., 2020) also reported that airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of COVID-19 infected travelers. The screening is intended to be a barrier for preventing infected people from entering into the country; however, evidence of its effectiveness remains limited. These are reasons that health officials are still unable to control the spread of this contagious disease. The transmission of the disease is closely linked to the asymptomatic and infected people and those visiting the countries with COVID-19 pandemic. (Figure 4) . The disease is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends.

Most respiratory virus may work and replicate at lower temperatures (34°-35°C) than the optimal range for epithelial tracheal-bronchial cells (37°-38°C) [10] , either for mucin layer fluidity: exposed to lower temperatures may less react to fight infections. This also causes vasoconstriction reducing blood flow and mucin production. Increasing the air temperature, therefore keeping the upper tract and trachea-bronchial temperature higher, may reduce the replication and diffusion of the respiratory virus. Older people have a weak and altered thermoregulatory response while children, that quickly develop a high body temperature that may halt viral replication, and more balanced immune response, /may have a better chance of fighting infections. SARS-CoV-2 binding the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1β which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1βwhich is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis [11] , cardiovascular implications [12] [13] for increased troponin T (TnT), C-reactive protein and terminal fragment of type B natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP ), microvascular endothelial aggression and intestinal-pulmonary cross-talk, with link to colangiocyte ACE2 receptor, interfering with intestinal microbiota [14] requiring pro-biotic adjuvant therapy. This infectious disease mostly affects men, since immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome [11] . The two coronaviruses that preceded CoV-19 causing respectively the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) pandemic of 2003 [15] and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2012 [16] , emerged during the summer and spring-summer season, thus not respecting the principle that "respiratory viruses can only function (and replicate) at lower temperatures (i.e. 34-35°C)", as stated [10] . The MERS, moreover, is still ongoing in endemic form since 2012, therefore disrespectful of the summer-winter binomial. These concepts, are perhaps explainable that both viruses have made the so-called species jump (Spillover), thus modifying the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of both virus. SARS-CoV-2 probably behaves in the same way. Therefore, it cannot be accurately stated that this is thermolabile. The biological characteristics of the latter coronavirus are not yet known; SARS-CoV-2 also made the spillover, but passing directly from the bat to the man maybe without an intermediate host [17] .

T he 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease that can spread from 1 person to another. The novel coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified during an investigation of an outbreak in Wuhan, China. 1 The disease has been spreading worldwide since its inception, as the World Health Organization declared an epidemic on March 11, 2020. 2 COVID-19 cases in Iran reached 17 361 on March 17, while the death toll reached approximately 1135. The first death to COVID-19 was officially announced on February 20, 2020, in Qom. 3 The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems in countries around the world, including Iran, and led to the closure of face-to-face courses in schools and universities. 4 Therefore, virtual education can be seen as a turning point in education in Iran due to COVID-19. Virtual learning offers many benefits that traditional college degree programs do not provide, such as accessibility from anywhere at any time, asynchronous discussions with classmates, immediate feedback on tests, and flexibility. However, despite the benefits of virtual learning, it is not always easy to implement. 5 In Iran, virtual education for grade-school students is performed through scheduled programs through TV and mobile education through social media; and, in higher education, virtual instruction is performed through mobile messenger systems and learning management systems, such as NAVID, VESTA, and MOODLE.

In Italy, COVID-19 has been identified on January 2020 [5] and the outbreak started in Lombardia and Veneto at the end of February 2020. From the northern regions of Italy, the disease spread very quickly to the nearest regions and then to the rest ones. Italy has considered one of the main epicentres of the pandemic recording a number of infected equal to 97689 and a number of deaths equal to 10799 up to 29rd of March. In this paper we want to underline difference at regional level and to evidence how the disease has spread along time. To do this, both statistical and network-based analysis on Italian COVID-19 data has been performed. The data are daily provided by the Italian Civil Protection, and they refer to the period February 24 to March 29, 2020. In particular, we analyzed the Italian COVID-19 data at the regional level in order to evaluate which regions show a similar trend. Then, for each type of data, we built the related networks where the nodes represent the Italian region, and the edges represent a level of similarity among them. Finally, we evaluate how the networks evolve over the weeks up to the end of March 2020. The main contribution of the the paper is a network-based representation of COVID-19 diffusion similarity among regions and graphbased visualization to underline similar diffusion regions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the Italian COVID-19 data, the statistical and network-based analysis, Section 3 discusses the results, Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.

Determination of the primary structure of various guanylyltransferases from many viruses has allowed a better knowledge of the active site and catalytic mechanism of these enzymes. A lysine-containing motif, KxDG, is conserved among guanylyltransferases encoded by DNA viruses (vaccinia virus, Shope ®broma virus, African swine fever virus) and the yeasts S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (75, 76) . This motif is also conserved at the active site of polynucleotide ligases which, like guanylyltransferases, catalyze their reaction via the formation of a covalent Lys-nucleoside monophosphate intermediate (77) . In addition to the active guanylyltransferase site (KxDG), other conserved sequence elements were identi®ed in guanylyltransferases from DNA viruses and yeasts (76) . These elements were shown to be essential for capping enzyme function in vivo (76) . Although the reovirus l2 protein covalently binds GTP, it lacks these conserved motifs. A similar situation is observed in rotavirus VP3 and bluetongue virus VP4 proteins, all viral guanylyltransferases from viruses of the Reoviridae family. These capping enzymes apparently evolved differently from other viral and cellular guanylyltransferases, despite their identical enzymatic functions. The Lys(226) residue of the reovirus l2 protein KPTNG sequence has been identi®ed as the GMP attachment site (71) ; this sequence differs from the consensus signature of DNA viruses (KxDG) but is related to the murine rotavirus SA-11 VP3 protein sequence and bluetongue virus VP4 (KxT(x)G) (Fig. 8a) . The presence of bulky aliphatic residues (I, L, V, M) following the KxT(x)G consensus sequence was also revealed by this alignment (Fig. 8a) . Furthermore, another motif (YxR) is conserved between the reovirus l2 protein (YVRKN), the VP3 protein of the murine rotavirus SA-11 (YYRYN) and the bluetongue virus VP4 protein (YKRKM). Mutagenesis of these residues might eventually reveal important amino acids involved in guanylate binding or GMP transfer from the enzyme to the acceptor mRNA molecules. This alignment also showed that the reovirus l2 protein shares a higher degree of similarity with the guanylyltransferase of bluetongue virus (41% similarity) than with guanylyltransferase from human and simian rotavirus (22 and 34% similarity, respectively) over these two domains of 32 amino acids.

Communicability. Communicability of a disease is another measure to determine the capability of a pathogen to be transmitted from one human or animal to another. The basic reproduction number (R0 or R naught) determines the severity of an epidemic. It indicates the average number of people that will be infected by a single person ("The Source"). Measles and pertussis (whooping cough) have an R0 of around 15 meaning one person can transmit the disease to an average of 15 other persons in a population that has not developed any immunity or has not been vaccinated. It is worth noting that both diseases are spread via airborne transmission. R0 is also a useful measure for explaining how a new, emerging disease spreads in a vulnerable population. If R0 is less than 1 the disease will die out, if it is equal to one the disease will remain stable in a population, and if it is greater than 1 it can cause an outbreak or epidemic. Based on data from early transmission of COVID-19 in an unprotected population in Wuhan, the average R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 2.2 47 but other studies suggest a higher R0 value. 48 A more recent analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak in China during the same time period, using mathematical modeling and including high-resolution domestic travel and infection data, determined R0 for SARS-CoV-2 to be 5.7. 49 This makes COVID-19 a far more contagious disease compared to SARS and MERS. The R0 value for SARS-CoV-1 was estimated to be 3.0 50 and for MERS-CoV 0.45. 51 Seasonal flu, for which herd immunity exists, has an R0 of 1.3. What are the practical implications of R0 values? The higher the R0 value, the faster a disease spreads through the population as the spread is exponential (Figure 2 ). Once the population approaches saturation, that is, everyone is diseased, the spread levels off. Social distancing can reduce R0 by lowering the probability of person-to-person transmission. Since individuals already shed What else can change R0 of a disease? There is the possibility that a virus could mutate to become more or less efficient in establishing an infection, resulting in a higher or lower R0, respectively. In addition, some infected individuals participate in superspreading events where excessive disease spreading is traced to a single person, who is also called a superspreader (reviewed by Stein 2011). 52 Well documented in the news is a woman in Korea traveling home from Wuhan and infecting 37 members during one large church event, who then went on to spread the disease to hundreds of other church members within a short period of time. At a birthday party in the US one person already ill with COVID-19 infected approximately 50 partygoers who subsequently scattered to different states in the US and traveled abroad infecting many people in their path. 53 Other documented cases of superspreader events are known for MERS and SARS. 52 A MERS superspreading event played a significant role in the outbreak of MERS in Korea in 2015. A businessman returning from the Middle East was treated at a hospital from which the disease was spread to other hospitals to which patients were transferred where MERS then became a nosocomial disease (that is, a disease originating in a hospital). Because of the superspreading hospital events, the R0 value for MERS was increased to 8.1. 54 In any case, whether it is the physiological nature of a certain individual or their social practices, superspreading events play a significant role in spreading emerging diseases. Examples of social gatherings that could become superspreading events contributing to rapid disease spread include major holidays that involve traveling such as the Chinese New Year, Thanksgiving, school or college holidays, and major gatherings such as sports events and concerts, etc.

Epithelial cells (and their ECM), the most common cell type used as targets by microbes, are categorized into two groups, simple epithelium (one layer of cells) or stratified epithelium (two or more organ systems. This mechanism of spread is called "leukocyte trafficking." From local sites, infected lymphocytes and macrophages spread via lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes, where additional cells are infected and then spread via lymphatic vessels to the thoracic duct and the circulatory system. From here, infected cells spread systemically to other organ systems in which specific target cells are infected, including lymphoid organs such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Additionally, microbes can use nerve endings and fibers (that travel to and throughout all organ systems via the central nervous system [CNS] and peripheral nervous system [PNS] ) to spread within the nervous system and/or systemically. Lastly, target cells located systemically within other organ systems tend to be epithelial cells, macrophages (monocytes), Figure 4-6 Target Cells. A, Target cells forming "barrier systems." Target cells encountered at portals of entry (i.e., barrier systems) and within organ systems of the body following systemic spread include simple or stratified epithelium (squamous, cuboidal, or columnar types). These cells cover and line surfaces (pleurae, pericardium, airways, ducts) , form the parenchyma of organ systems such as hepatocytes in the liver, line organs (endothelium, synovium), and form glands (endocrine, exocrine [e.g., adrenal, pancreas] ). Additionally, biologic substances, such as mucus, synthesized and released from these cells into their surroundings can be used by some microbes as target substances (not shown in figure) . B, Target cells used to spread microbes. Target cells used by microbes to spread via leukocyte trafficking, regionally or systemically, to other organ systems include cells of the monocyte-macrophage system, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. These cells may also be primary target cells for microbes in addition to being used as cells to travel in throughout the body. C, Target cells unique to the nervous system. Some microbes can enter nerve endings of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (cranial and spinal nerves) in mucosa and dermis/subcutis at portals of entry and use retrograde and anterograde axonal transport to spread to and through neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Other cells, including microglial cells (as part of the monocyte-macrophage system), and astrocytes can then become targets for infection.

The epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that COVID can be transmitted from person to person and the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 [10] . We observed the mean number of secondary symptomatic cases in household exposure setting was 2.43. Our findings highly support the evidence of human-to-human transmission of COVID. All pediatric patients had an epidemiological link directly or indirectly to Wuhan or other endemic area of Hubei, where the outbreak of COVID originated and is ongoing. Most of pediatric cases occurring outside of Wuhan were secondary cases after exposure to adult cases through household contact or travel contact. However, we can not neglect the potential risk of transmission from the infected child to adult contacts, as shown in patient 7. Thus, personal medical protection is crucial when care providers look after the infected child. The major pattern of transmission was intrafamily transmission. The general transmission pattern of COVID is similar to that of SARS and MERS in children [11, 12] . Based on our field investigation, the mean incubation period between household exposure to a symptomatic adult case and symptom onset was 6.5 days, longer than 5.4 days observed in adult cases [10] . This difference could be suggestive of longer Virus shedding in respiratory specimens is longer in children with mild COVID, which will impose a challenge for infection control. 2019-nCoV RNA was not detected in serum samples in our study. Viremia could be related to the severity of disease because 2019-nCoV RNA was detected in blood samples obtained from 15% of adult patients with pneumonia [9] . Surprisingly, we also noted a high frequency (83.3%) of 2019-nCoV RNA detection in feces in mild patients and prolonged virus RNA shedding in feces for at least 2 weeks and even more than 1 month, which raises a question

Although events of successful viral spillover to distantly related species are thought to be extremely rare, in recent years coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV [1] , MERS-CoV [2] [3] [4] [5] and PED-CoV [8] , have spilled over from bats to other species. Circumstantial evidence suggests that most alpha and beta coronaviruses parasitizing other mammals may also have originated in bats [23] . Little is known at present about the dynamics of coronavirus infection in the reservoir bat hosts, or how the viruses are spread from bat to bat, or from bats to other mammals. In this study, we examined a coronavirus in its natural host, the little brown bat. This study system provides a useful model for understanding factors that may promote spillovers. Our results suggest the following: (a) the Myotis coronavirus (Myl-CoV) is mainly present in the intestines and lungs; (b) co-hibernating little and big brown bats may share closely related coronaviruses; (c) Myl-CoV can persist in M. lucifugus for up to 4 months, the hibernation period of our experiment; and (d) the presence of Myl-CoV in bronchial epithelium is associated with minimal pathology or inflammation. However, a larger sample size under controlled conditions of exposure, with more rapid fixation of tissues, is required to fully characterize the lesions in lung and intestines. Dominguez et al. [24] and others [20] previously detected a coronavirus in little and big brown bats, suggesting that the virus may infect bats of both species, crossing between the bats at shared co-hibernation sites. The virus originally detected in a big brown bat was named the Rocky Mountain coronavirus [24] for the location of its initial detection. The RNA amplified from little brown bats in this study appeared to be from two distinct clades. The sequences in clade 1 were very similar to the archived sequence derived from little brown bats and the sequences from clade 2 were more closely related to the archived sequence from big brown bats. This suggests that two closely related coronaviruses may circulate in little brown bats. Although the sequence traces did not suggest a mixture of PCR products, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the individual bats were infected with viruses from both clades, and that the PCR likely favoured the predominant viral component.

We have presented a methodology that allow the study of diffusive processes in (PPI) networks varying from normal to subdiffusive regimes. Here we have studied the particular case in which the time-fractional diffusion equation produces a subdiffusive regime, with the use of α = 3/4 in the network of human proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2. A characteristic feature of this PPI network is that the second smallest eigenvalue is very small, i.e., µ 2 = 0.0647. As this eigenvalue determines the rate of convergence to the steady state, the subdiffusive process converges very slowly to that state. What it has been surprising is that even in these conditions of very small convergence to the steady state, there is a very early increase of the probability in those proteins closely connected to the initiator of the diffusive process. That is, in a subdiffusive process on a network, the time at which a perturbation is transmitted from the initiator to any of its nearest neighbors occurs at an earlier time than for the normal diffusion. This is a consequence of the fact that E α,1 (−γt α ) decreases very fast at small values of t α , which implies that the perturbation occurring at a protein i at t = 0 is transmitted almost instantaneously to the proteins closely connected to i. This effect may be responsible for the explanation about why subdiffusive processes, which are so globally slow, can carry out cellular processes at a significant rate in cells. We have considered here a mechanism consisting in switching and restarting several times during the global cellular process. For instance, a subdiffusive process starting at the protein i perturbs its nearest neighbors at very early times, among which we can find the protein j. Then, a new subdiffusive process can be restarted again at the node j, and so on.

The first confirmed case outside Wuhan in China was reported on January 19 (Shenzhen) . Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the COVID-19 can be transmitted from person to person. As of January 30, a total of 9976 cases had been reported in at least 21 countries 2 . Early detection of COVID-19 importation and prevention of onward transmission are crucial to all areas at risk of importation from areas with active transmissions (Gilbert et al., 2020) . To contain the virus, Wuhan was placed under lockdown with residents not allowed to leave the city on January 23. On the same or the next day, most public transportation stopped in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. In addition, most cities in Hubei province had adopted blockade measures for Class A infectious diseases by January 28 3 . Residents in those areas are highly encouraged to stay at home and not to attend any gathering activity. Besides, at least 207 cities in China have adopted similar though softer measures by February 12. People are frequently reminded by media and community workers to maintain safe social distance. Furthermore, many cities require that recent visitors to high COVID-19 risk areas quarantine themselves at home or in designated facilities for 14 days. Residents who have symptoms of fever or dry cough are required to report the situation to community, and are quarantined and treated in special medical facilities. Governments also trace and isolate contacts of those patients.

The concepts used in developing laboratory biosafety guidelines forms the basis for categorisation of biological agents by risk group and the designation of appropriate biosafety levels. These concepts rely on expert risk assessment of the severity of human infection, the potential for transmission to exposed individuals and to the wider community or environment, and the availability of effective prophylaxis or treatment. Additional assessments include likely ease of dissemination by terrorists and the estimated overall impact of any dissemination to generate lists of 'critical agents' [6, 7] . The lists then rank the biological agents that might be used in deliberate release by priority, and identify measures needed to ensure public health preparedness. Critical agent lists are also being used to set priorities in biodefence research, including basic research on biology and pathogenesis, and development and evaluation of molecular diagnostic assays, vaccines, antivirals, and other preventive or therapeutic interventions [8] . Although critical agent lists generally make provision for inclusion of newly recognised or recently emergent pathogens, they were developed specifically to improve preparedness for bioterror events. So though all categorise smallpox virus as a high-priority, 'category A pathogen', none accords high-priority to highly pathogenic influenza viruses, or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, despite the fact that these viruses are epidemic prone, and capable of rapid global spread and enormous public health impact. The term 'highly infectious diseases' describes infections caused by pathogens that are transmissible from person to person, cause severe or life-threatening illness; present a serious hazard in healthcare settings and in the community; and require specific control measures, which may include management of cases in a highly secure isolation unit. It thus includes some, but not all, of the infections caused by category A critical agents (including smallpox, Lassa, Marburg, Ebola and Congo Crimean haemorrhagic fevers, and pneumonic plague, but excluding anthrax, bubonic plague, tularaemia and botulism because these are not transmissible from person to person), and also includes SARS, influenza caused by avian influenza virus H5N1 or other highly pathogenic influenza virus, and unusual illness of unknown, but possibly infectious, aetiology.

The process of ubiquitination is a multi-step process ultimately leading to the covalent modification of a protein substrate with small molecule ubiquitin. There are three types of ubiquitination: 1) mono-ubiquitination in which single ubiquitin is attached to target 2) multi ubiquitination or poly-mono-ubiquitination where several single ubiquitin are attached to target proteins 3) poly ubiq- uitination where substrate is attached with poly-ubiquitin chains (D'Arcy et al., 2015; Jentsch and Schlenker, 1995; Di Fiore et al., 2003; Lander et al., 2012) . Ubiquitin has ∼ =76 conserved amino acid protein that covalently attached through a peptide bond between the carboxyl glycine residues at 76 position of ubiquitin to the amino groups of lysine residues in target proteins. The process of ubiquitination depends on the consecutive activity of three distinct enzymes, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and ubiquitin-ligase or E3 ubiquitin ligase (E3) ( fig. 1 ). In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by the E1 in the presence of ATP, forming a thio-ester bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin and the active site cysteine of the E1 enzyme. Once activated, ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to a cysteine residue of E2 ubiquitin carrier proteins. Substrate specificity is mediated by E3 ligases, which bind target substrates and coordinate the covalent attachment of ubiquitin. Two distinct families of E3 ligases exist, the HECT domain family that receives ubiquitin from the E2 ligase forming an ubiquitin-E3 intermediate, and the RING finger family of E3 ligases that form a molecular bridge between the E2 ligase and target proteins (D'Arcy et al., 2015; Ross et al., 2015; Voges et al., 1999; Pickart and Eddins, 2004) . Once ubiquitin-E2, E3 and substrate complex is formed, ubiquitin binds to the substrate which is mediated by E3 ligase. In the subsequent process E2 and E3 are removed from complex and substrate protein will be either degraded or alternatively substrated could be free from ubiquitin through deubiquitinases and remain active ( fig. 1 ).

Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most common diseases to affect humans with typical symptoms, such as rhinitis, cough, fever, and sore throat. 1 Most of these infections are caused by viruses. Bacterial RTIs are less common and often develop after a viral infection. In children <5 years, 95% of the sore throat cases are caused by viruses; 85%-95% in adults. Only in the group of 5-to 15-year-old children, this percentage is reduced to 70%. 2 Viruses associated with RTIs are picornaviruses (human rhinoviruses [HRV] ), coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human coronavirus [hCoV] OC43), ortho-and paramyxoviruses (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus), and adeno-and herpesviruses. 3 RTIs are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets or indirectly via contaminated surfaces. 4 A reduction of the viral load on the site of infection reduces the risk of transmission via both routes while simultaneously reducing the symptoms of the patients and a potential spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract. Locally acting lozenges or sprays reach the site of infection directly, hereby minimizing potential side effects due to limited systemic uptake while maximizing efficacy.

New confirmed and death cases also depicted in Fig. 5g and 5h. Being one of the first countries reporting the outbreak of COVID-19, the first report was on Jan 20. However, no outbreak was observed by Feb 18th, after which there was a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases. Comparison between the growth trend in numbers from South Korea from this date with China's in the early stages is depicted in Fig. 5e as shown the growth rate patterns are approximately the same between the two, showing a very similar behavior in the increasing numbers of confirmed cases. COVID-19 spreads from human to human [5] , therefore in addition to isolation of people, social avoidance and quarantine policies, faster detection of infected cases should reduce further growth. Each infected individual, by having contact with others directly or by proxy, (in other words by activity) could infect a number of people, so to reduce the odds of transmission of virus, faster detection of infected individuals could play a key role alongside lockdown strategies. Based on the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), as of March 8th 2020, a total number of 188,518 cases have been screened and tested for HCoV infection [13] . More than 10,000 tests had been taken on March 8th, and just in two days, this number has reached to 210,144 (indicating more than 20,000 tests had been taken in 2 days). At this date, South Korea reached to 4099 taken-tests per million people. The magnitude of this number clearly shows the policy of South Korea, an attempt to reduce the duration of detection, through a faster detection strategy [30] . Furthermore, the fact that the CFR in the old South Korean affected adults [12] (patients above 70 years) is still lower than that of Italian HCoV affected patients (average 47 years old), better signifies the role of early detection in controlling the epidemic.

Nonetheless, other groups charged the Center with stigmatizing the gay men population, similar to the arguments made in the blood ban context. See: Pulver, supra note 12, at 127. 33

The new disease was transmitted from person to person for about 8 months and then disappeared after an unprecedented level of international cooperation and collaboration. By July 5, 2003, WHO was able to declare that “all known chains of person-to-person transmission of the SARS coronavirus” had been broken.7 Whether SARS would have become endemic in people or in an animal reservoir without this determined global health response will never be known. One clear lesson that emerged from the outbreak, however, was that inadequate surveillance and response capacity in one country can endanger not only its population, but also global public health security.8

It is now 6 weeks since Chinese health authorities announced the discovery of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1] causing a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the major transport hub of central China. The earliest human infections had occurred by early December 2019, and a large wet market in central Wuhan was linked to most, but not all, of the initial cases [2] . While evidence from the initial outbreak investigations seemed to suggest that 2019-nCoV could not easily spread between humans [3] , it is now very clear that infections have been spreading from person to person [2] . We recently estimated that more than 75,000 infections may have occurred in Wuhan as at 25 January 2020 [4] , and increasing numbers of infections continue to be detected in other cities in mainland China and around the world. A number of important characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection have already been identified, but in order to calibrate public health responses we need improved information on transmission dynamics, severity of the disease, immunity, and the impact of control and mitigation measures that have been applied to date.

COVID-19 has rapidly affected our day to day life, businesses, disrupted the world trade and movements. Identification of the disease at an early stage is vital to control the spread of the virus because it very rapidly spreads from person to person. Most of the countries have slowed down their manufacturing of the products 3 This COVID-19 has affected the sources of supply and effects the global economy. There are restrictions of travelling from one country to another country. During travelling, numbers of cases are identified positive when tested, especially when they are taking international visits 5 . All governments, health organisations and other authorities are continuously focusing on identifying the cases affected by the COVID-19. Healthcare professional face lot of difficulties in maintaining the quality of healthcare in these days.

Lessons learnt from the SARS outbreak were able to be applied when MERS-CoV emerged in the Middle East during 2012-2013. As a result of rapid data sharing, a reliable and powerful diagnostic of MERS-CoV became available worldwide within just a few months of the virus's first isolation and identification. Like SARS CoV, MERS-CoV is closely related to bat viruses with an as yet unknown reservoir. The high prevalence of camels that are seropositive for MERS-CoV, or a closely related virus, and the isolation of MERS-CoV from camels are suggestive of a possible amplifying host, and therefore, further studies to monitor virus infections in camels are highly recommended in order to assess their potential role in MERS-CoV virus transmission. The transmission of the MERS-CoV to humans in general needs further study to clarify the role of the amplifying host and whether the virus is transmitted from bats to camels and then to humans, or whether other amplifying hosts are involved. The factors associated with the increased virulence and mortality rate in men compared to women should also be investigated. However, in the Arab countries, people usually try to avoid hospitalisation, which is more frequent for adults than children, and for females more than males. Determinants of host susceptibility to MERS-CoV should be carefully and intensively studied, and whether this depends on the presence of specific receptors or whether there are other host metabolic determinants. An important question that requires large and comprehensive serological surveillance is whether MERS-CoV was introduced to and circulated in the general population in the countries of the Middle East, or possibly other countries worldwide, prior to the first reported cases. Many reliable assays have been developed that allow serological screening and surveillance should be conducted on a wide scale among humans and different animal species to determine the exact rate of spread of MERS-CoV.

The first confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was in June 2012. A previously healthy 60-year old Saudi male was hospitalized on 10th June 2012 in Bisha in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) with acute community-acquired pneumonia and was subsequently transferred to a private hospital in Jeddah on 13th June 2012, where he died on 24th June due to respiratory and renal failure (Zaki et al., 2012) . Indirect immunofluorescence assays on day 1 sputum samples were negative for influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, however cytopathic changes in LLC-MK2 and Vero cells inoculated with the patient's sputum indicated the likelihood of viral replication (Zaki et al., 2012) . PCR testing was negative for adenovirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus, herpesviruses, and paramyxoviruses but positive for detection of coronaviruses (Zaki et al., 2012) . Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the identification of a new virus belonging in lineage C of the betacoronavirus genus and initially named human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC) (Zaki et al., 2012) . In September 2012, the same virus was identified in a 49-year-old man who had been transferred from a hospital in Qatar to London with an unexplained, severe respiratory illness which required intubation and ventilation (Bermingham et al., 2012) . Importantly, this man had a history of travel in KSA, where he had experienced a mild undiagnosed respiratory illness in August 2012 (Bermingham et al., 2012) . The first cluster of human cases was retrospectively confirmed from a group of 13 people who had become ill with an unexplained respiratory illness in a public hospital in Zarqa city in Jordan in April 2012 (Hijawi et al., 2013) .

Template-switching, otherwise known as copy-choice recombination, can occur during the process of RNA synthesis if the viral polymerase transfers from one template to another, while remaining attached to the nascent nucleic acid chain [42] . This results in production of a mosaic genome. Template switching tends to occur between sequences of close similarity to give rise to a homologous recombination event. Nonhomologous recombination can also occur, but this typically results in defective genomes and is observed less frequently. Viruses differ significantly in the rate with which they can recombine by template-switching [41] . It can be highly frequent in retroviruses, particularly HIV, and also in coronaviruses. The high frequency of recombination in these viruses may be due to the replication strategies that they have. In the case of retroviruses, the reverse transcription process is highly complex and the reverse transcriptase must switch from one template to another during DNA synthesis [43] . Likewise, in coronaviruses, transcription of the genome, to allow gene expression, requires the RdRp to transfer from one site to another on the genomic template [44] . Thus, the fact that the polymerases of these viruses have evolved to transfer to a different template sequence probably means they are more likely to do so during other aspects of RNA synthesis. Recombination can occur in other positive-strand RNA viruses besides coronaviruses, and in double-stranded RNA viruses, although the recombination frequency apparently varies between viruses. For example, it occurs frequently in the positive-stranded enteroviruses, such as poliovirus, but less so in the flaviviruses, such as HCV [45] . Template switch recombination is much less frequent in the negative-strand RNA viruses [46] , probably because their genomes are not naked RNA, but rather are encapsidated, or buried, in protein called nucleoprotein [47] . The polymerase transiently displaces nucleoprotein as it moves along the template and only recognizes RNA sequences as the nucleoprotein is displaced. This probably prevents the RdRp from transferring from one genome to a similar sequence in another genome to yield functional recombinants. However, negative-strand RNA viruses containing gene duplications have arisen naturally [48] and defective interfering genomes, which contain promoters and partial genome sequences, but not complete genomes, are often detected. These findings suggest that the RdRps of the negative-strand RNA viruses are capable of jumping from one sequence to another, or that nonreplicative recombination (described later) can come into play, but perhaps most products of these events are nonviable and so are not detected.

Emerging or re-emerging infections, including avian influenza (AI), pandemic human influenza and coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS--CoV), can cause severe respiratory illness and death and cause international outbreaks that can threaten global health security [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In 2003 and 2004, the World Health Organization reported that the avian influenza A H5N1 virus had spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, resulting in millions of poultry infections, 50 human cases, and 36 human deaths [7, 8] . These avian influenza outbreaks have had serious impact on national economies and international trade. In response, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) established the National Avian Influenza Surveillance (NAIS) system in 2004 to detect influenza in severe pneumonia patients [9] .

The time of COVID-19 outbreak is at the Chinese Spring Festival Travel Rush (Chunyun). During this time, many people back their hometown for celebrating Spring Festival, and the virus quickly spread from Wuhan to other parts of China with the flow of people. On January 29, 31 provinces in the Chinese mainland launched the first level response mechanism for public health events (the highest). In order to prevent the further spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government decided to begin strict controls on entering and leaving Wuhan from January 23, and since then personnel have rarely continued to flow from Wuhan. As of two incubation cycles since Wuhan was sealed on January 23, that is, Figure 1 shows that there is a significant positive correlation between GDP and confirmed cases in different regions of an epidemic area. According to this finding, the epidemic prevention and control in different economic development areas in one region can be graded. In areas with high economic development level, the epidemic risk is high, and the more active and strict epidemic prevention measures should be taken. Such as: call on the public to reduce the flow as much as possible; do a well in personal protection.

Feline vaccines have been, and continue to be largely advocated for routine yearly booster vaccination, but are also not without their problems-for example the continued prevalence of ''cat flu'' despite years of vaccination. This is in part due to the persistence of these viruses in their host, enabling spread from stressed lactating queens to their kittens before they can be practically vaccinated, but possibly also due to issues of cross protection (or lack of) between vaccinal strains (e.g. F9 calicivirus) and field strains of ever changing virulence. More work is required to develop vaccines with broader efficacy, and FCV vaccines may need to be multivalent in future. Feline panleucopenia vaccines have been much more effective, and offer clearer potential for extended DOI claims. FeLV vaccines have also been successful but are unlikely to lend themselves to extended DOI claims. There are no vaccines currently available in the UK for other common and serious feline diseases caused by viruses such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline coronavirus (causing the FIP complex), and these diseases remain a problem in practice.

Ten years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been identified as the cause of a highly lethal pneumonia in patients in the Middle East and in travelers from this region. Over the past 9 months, since the virus was first isolated, much has been learned about the biology of the virus. It is now clear that MERS-CoV is transmissible from person to person, and its close relationship with several bat coronaviruses suggests that these animals may be the ultimate source of the infection. However, many key issues need to be addressed, including identification of the proximate, presumably zoonotic, source of the infection, the prevalence of the infection in human populations, details regarding clinical and pathological features of the human infection, the establishment of a small rodent model for the infection, and the virological and immune basis for the severe disease observed in most patients. Most importantly, we do not know whether a MERS-CoV epidemic is likely or not. Infection with the virus has so far resulted in only 91 cases and 46 deaths (as of 29 July 2013), but it is nonetheless setting off alarm bells among public health officials, including Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, who called MERS-CoV “a threat to the entire world.” This article reviews some of the progress that has been made and discusses some of the questions that need to be answered.

Besides their large genome sizes, coronaviruses and related nidoviruses stick out from other plus-strand RNA viruses by the large number of virally encoded nonstructural proteins that are either involved in viral RNA synthesis or interact with host cell functions (reviewed in Masters and Perlman, 2013; Ziebuhr, 2008) . Most of the nonstructural proteins (nsp) are expressed as subdomains of two large replicase gene-encoded polyproteins called pp1a (∼450 kDa) and pp1ab (∼750 kDa). Co-and posttranslational cleavage of pp1a/1ab by two types of virus-encoded proteases gives rise to a total of 15-16 mature proteins that (together with the nucleocapsid protein and cellular proteins) form the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) (Almazán et al., 2004; Schelle et al., 2005; Ziebuhr, 2008; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . This multi-protein complex replicates the viral genome and produces an extensive set of 3 -coterminal subgenomic messenger RNAs (sg mRNAs), the latter representing a hallmark of corona-and other nidoviruses (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007; Ziebuhr and Snijder, 2007) . The sg mRNAs are used to express open reading frames located in the 3 -proximal third of the genome. They essentially encode the viral structural proteins, such as the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), spike (S) and envelope (E) proteins, and a varying number of accessory proteins, the latter often involved in functions that counteract antiviral host responses (Masters and Perlman, 2013; Narayanan et al., 2008b) . Coronavirus sg mRNAs contain a common 5 leader sequence (approximately 60-95 nt) that is identical to the 5 end of the genome. The complement of this sequence is attached to the 3 end of nascent negative strands in a complex process called "discontinuous extension of negative strands" Sawicki, 1995, 1998; Sawicki et al., 2007; Sethna et al., 1991) . This process involves attenuation of negativestrand RNA synthesis at transcription-regulating sequences (TRS) located upstream of the individual ORFs in the 3 -proximal genome region ("body TRSs", TRS-B). Guided by basepairing interactions between the negative-strand complement of a TRS-B and the TRS located downstream of the 5 leader on the viral genome ("leader TRS", TRS-L), the nascent minus strand may be transferred from its downstream position on the template (at the TRS-B) to the TRS-L, where negative-strand RNA synthesis is then resumed and completed by copying the 5 leader sequence. The set of 3 antileader-containing sg minus-strand RNAs is subsequently used as templates for the production of the characteristic nested set of 5 capped, 5 leader-containing and 3 -polyadenylated sg mRNAs in coronavirus-infected cells (Lai et al., 1983; Sawicki et al., 2001; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995; Sethna et al., 1989; Spaan et al., 1983) . Sg minus-strand RNAs contain a U-stretch at their 5 end, thus providing a template for 3 polyadenylation of sg mRNAs Wu et al., 2013) .

Both methods thus allow structural information of the assembly to be obtained, even when there is little or no prior knowledge available on the mechanism of the selfassembly. Nucleotides and α-amino acids are crucial building blocks for living organisms. These chiral molecules are the biosynthetically precursors of two of the most important classes of biopolymers, DNA and proteins, respectively. The 3D-structures of biomolecules are currently studied using a variety of techniques, while helical handedness is routinely detected by means of light pulses of opposite circular polarization. The difference in the UV absorption of these two circularly polarized pulses is called electronic circular dichroism (ECD). In Nature, biomolecules explore a wide range of conformations with intrinsically strong ECD signals in the 200-300 nm region, but these signals are essentially absent in the visible. Nanomaterials such as metallic nanoparticles (depending on their sizes) display absorptions in the visible region but are achiral. As a result, when biomolecules are co-assembled with nanomaterials their chirality is transferred to create a plasmon-induced ECD signal in the visible region. In this work, we present our results which underscore the occurrence of moderately strong ECD bands in the range 300-550 nm resulting from a series of appropriately thiolfunctionalized peptide oligomers (based on alternating L-Ala and Aib residues) covalently anchored to 2-2.5 nm sized gold nanoparticles. We related the (positive or negative) signs of the ECD plasmonic signal with the oligopeptide length, that in turn is strictly associated with their secondary structure. This latter property was simultaneously monitored via ECD in the 200-250 nm range. We believe that in our systems a peptide-tometallic surface chirality transfer would take place. Light can be controlled with high temporal and spatial precision. If a specific molecule is made light-sensitive, then a precise spatiotemporal control of some of its properties can be achieved. Azobenzene is the most widely used photochromic group due to its propensity to pass reversibly from the cis to the trans state under irradiation with light of the appropriate wavelength. The cisand transazobenzene isomers exhibit different spatial arrangement of the aromatic moieties that give rise to significantly distinct physical and chemical properties. The design of novel azobenzene-based molecules with precisely placed photochromic groups able to induce photomodulation of macroscopic properties is currently attracting much interest.

The outbreak of SARS in 2003 exemplifies the impact of spatial mobility and the dynamic role of travelers. In 2002, a previously unrecognized coronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory infections in the Guangdong Province of China. The virus apparently jumped species from civet cats to humans, although subsequent research suggests that the reservoir host is the fruit bat. 31 The outbreak became visible to the world community when an infected physician from Guangdong, who stayed for a day in Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong, was the source of infection for multiple hotel guests, who then disseminated the virus to numerous other countries. By May, more than 8000 SARS infections had been reported. 32 By July, 29 countries and territories across five continents reported outbreaks and attributed 774 fatalities to SARS. 32 Transmission of SARS on aircraft occurred at rates of 0% to 18.3%, and occurred as far as seven rows from the source passenger. 33 One particular SARS case showed the potential for rapid international dispersion of a pathogen that is spread from person to person. 34 A businessman flew from Hong Kong to Frankfurt, Germany, on March 30, 2003 . He traveled on seven flights throughout Europe during a 5-day period, including stops in Barcelona, London, Munich, and Hong Kong. He was hospitalized in Hong Kong on April 8 for suspected SARS, subsequently confirmed on April 10. 34 Responding to SARS outbreak, the CDC issued advisories to avoid travel to the SARS-affected countries. Most countries in Asia instituted strict quarantine measures and restricted travel to reduce cross-border spread and as intracountry spread. The CDC temporarily suspended international adoption from China because of concern for dissemination.

The proposed model extends the SIR model to a more realistic scenario to achieve a better correlation to the COVID-19 disease, since the model was created specifically for the disease, we named the model as COmplexVID-19. Our strategy is based on a multi-layer network to represent the Brazilian demography and its different characteristics of social relationships. Each layer is composed of a set of groups representing how people interact in a given social context. In the network, a node represents a person and the edges are the social relationships between persons, and they are also the means through which the disease can be transmitted. The virus spreads from an infected node to neighboring nodes at each iteration step (1 step = 1 day), according to a given infection probability. First, we describe how the layers are built based on social data from Brazil.
15763854	spread	blood donor	recipient	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169312/pdf/	PMC7169312	10.1111/vox.12100_1		24176003		11	11	13	14	16	16	Transfusion-transmitted infections ( TTIs ) are blood-borne microbes that can be spread from blood donor to recipient via transfusion .	Tadokoro K and Satake M Japanese Red Cross Society, Tokyo, Japan It is estimated that there are 2 billion HBV-infected people including 350 million HBV-carriers in the world. It is highly endemic in South Africa, Amazon, and Southeast-Central Asia. The genotype of HBV is geographically characteristic, e.g. genotype B and C are the major in East Asia. HBV transmission remains the most frequent transfusion-transmitted viral infection despite the implementation of various screening tests applied in different settings. The residual risk is mainly related to donations either in the pre-sero (or pre-DNA)-conversion window period or occult HBV infection (OBI) where blood test is HBV-DNA-positive and HBs-Ag-negative. Infectivity of HBV depends on the transfused blood (viral load, phase of infection, genotype, and anti-HBs in the concurrent blood) and immune status of the recipients (anti-HBs, immunocompetence). It was shown that infectivity is dependent on viral load. Allain et al reported that FFPs is more infectious than PCs or RBCs. The minimal infectious dose of blood in late acute infection phase in chimpanzee and chimeric mice is approximately 10 times higher than that of pre-acute phase. Satake et al reported that transmission rate of OBI-derived components with low titer anti-HBc was 1/33(3%), whereas that of anti-HBc-negative components was 11/22(50%), which was verified in the lookback programme conducted in Japan. Allain et al showed in the study conducted in Europe that adjusted transmission rate of OBI blood was 28%, and the rate was higher without anti-HBs(63.8%) and lower with anti-HBs(15.4%). Discrepancy of transmission rate of OBI-derived blood between above two reports might be related to the different cutoff levels of anti-HBc and presence or absence of anti-HBs. DNA-positivity rate among OBI-derived components is higher in those with the higher levels of anti-HBc and lower in those with the presence of anti-HBs. There has been no report of transmission by OBI-derived blood with anti-HBs of 200mIU/ml or more. Screening test for HBV is different between countries. Low endemic countries screen blood for HBs-Ag, anti-HBc and mini-pooled NAT, while highly endemic countries test for HBs-Ag without anti-HBc, because high prevalence of anti-HBc-positive donation hamper securing necessary blood. Japan as a moderately endemic country had tested for HBs-Ag, mini-pool NAT and anti-HBc/anti-HBs where anti-HBs of more than 200 mIU/ml irrespective of anti-HBc and low anti-HBc with agglutination-inhibition titer of no more than 2 5 is qualified. Transfusion-transmitted HBV cases related to window period donations declined by increasing the sensitivity of mini pool NAT, whereas those related to blood with low titer anti-HBc remained stable with around 10 cases annually. In order to decrease such transmission Japanese Red Cross implemented a novel strategy to eliminate all anti-HBc-positive donations with anti-HBs <200 mIU/ml. Considering the frequency of donations with low titer anti-HBc has decreased to 1.3%, loss of those donations was estimated to be covered by promoting donations, Each country should establish its own HBV screening strategy considering the prevalence of HBV, residual risk of transmission, balance between safety and securing blood, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation of individual donation NAT and universal vaccination could further reduce further the risk of HBV transmission. our blood service is to motivate other population groups to diversify the age and gender composition of our donors. Forty-two percent of the whole blood donors participate in blood donation only once a year, so we need develop programs to motivate them to re-join blood donation. Also, we have to solve the annually recurring problem of blood shortages for transfusion during the winter and summer season. In the long term, our donor base is going to decrease gradually because of the low birth rate in Korea and our rapidly aging population. Therefore we should prepare a sustainable solution for a stable blood supply. Aims: Present methods to recruit blood donors based on age, gender and occupation groups for a stable blood supply. Methods: To make blood donation more accessible to individual donors, fixed donation sites are continuously developed. Facilities of our fixed and mobile sites are improved to provide safe and comfortable environment to donors. Since 1999, we have been operating the 'Registered donor system' for registered donors who agreed to donate their blood on a regular basis. To raise awareness of the importance of blood donation among youth, high-school students blood donor groups called 'Red Campaigners' and groups of university students called 'Blood Donation Supporters' are actively participating in blood donation campaigns. To increase participation of the middle-aged group, agreements were made not only with enterprises and organizations but also with the government and public institutions. We have developed a computerized system for scheduling group donations according to demand and supply and for performance management. To recognize the necessity of blood donation, every 13th was designated as 'Blood Donation Day' in 2012. To deal with donor complaints and requests, a Customer Relationship Management Center has been established. Results: By increasing the number of fixed donation sites and making donation more accessible, rate of individual donations is getting increased. As of the end of June 2013, 250 agreements for blood donation had been signed with enterprises and organizations. Every year more than 100 thousand donors agree to donate on a regular basis, and so far about 600 thousand donors have been registered in the 'Registered donor system'. The campaign 'Every 13th is Blood Donation Day' has contributed to spread a positive perception about blood donation. Conclusions: We have been very successful in engaging youth in blood donation. Diversification of the donor group will take time and constant effort. However, with more participation of female donors and retention of our first-time donors, it will be possible to be self-sufficient in blood supply for transfusion and plasma fractionation. The provision of sufficient safe blood products to patients requiring transfusion is the common goal of blood transfusion services and the public expectation of absolute safety continues to be a challenge. Although the focus of blood safety falls on laboratory testing, the role of pre-donation donor selection cannot be underestimated. Transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) are blood-borne microbes that can be spread from blood donor to recipient via transfusion. To prevent TTI, donated blood must go through validated laboratory testing. In most countries, blood is tested for HIV, HBV, HCV, and Syphilis. Screening for other TTIs may also be implemented in some countries after individual assessment of the prevalence of the infection in their general populations, for example, West Nile virus in the United States. With the advance in testing technology, in particular the nucleic acid test, the window periods for the detection of various TTIs have been significantly shortened. However, the risk of window donation still exists. Furthermore, there are known or emerging TTIs such as the variant CreutzfeldtJakcob disease (vCJD) where there is still no suitable testing system for routine screening of donated blood. Therefore, blood transfusion services have to continue practicing effective pre-donation donor selection to mitigate the TTI risks. WHO recommends selecting voluntary, non-remunerated donors from low-risk populations for blood collection as the first step in reducing the risk of TTIs. Donor selection is usually conducted by a health history questionnaire to be completed by potential donors and a confidential interview. The questions asked should be effective in assessing whether the respondent's health status is suitable to donate and there is no TTI risk factor. People who are deferred should be counseled and given the reason for and duration of the deferral. WHO has published a document titled 'Blood donor selection -Guidelines on assessing donor suitability for blood donation'. It recommends the following: National donor selection guidelines and criteria should be based on epidemiological and/or scientific evidence or, where evidence is limited or lacking, on best practice. Donor acceptance and deferral policies for the prevention of TTI should be based on up-to-date information on the local epidemiology of infections, the markers screened for, the availability of suitable blood screening and confirmatory assays, and the technologies in use. National donor selection criteria should define conditions of acceptance and deferral for each criterion. Adequate resources, including a sufficient number of qualified and trained staff, should be made available for the consistent and reliable assessment of donor suitability for blood donation. Quality systems should be in place for donor selection, including selection criteria, staff training and documentation. Blood transfusion services should establish mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation to assess the implementation and effectiveness of donor selection criteria. In conclusion, pre-donation selection is essential to protect the safety and sufficiency of blood supply, and safeguard the health of recipients and donors.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] first appeared in southern China [Guangdong Province] in November 2002, as an atypical community pneumonia [1] . Within a year, the World Health Organization [WHO] reported 8096 cases with 774 deaths [9. 6% fatality] in >30 countries from five continents, and the outbreak was declared a pandemic infection [1] . In the elderly and subjects with significant comorbid illness, the mortality rate was up to 50%. Investigations revealed that SARS was due to a novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV] which was circulating among wild game animals in wet markets of southern China. The palm civet, a wild feline, was considered the amplification host that transmitted the virus to humans from occupational contact and handling by consumers during the preparation for consumption as a delicacy [2, 3] . SARS-CoV mainly spread from human to human by respiratory droplets or by contact of mucosae with contaminated fomites. Spread of SARS-CoV from mainland China to Hong Kong and other countries was from interpersonal transmission in healthcare facilities, homes, workplaces, and public transports [1] .

The material properties of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its proteins are discussed. We review the viral structure, size, rigidity, lipophilicity, isoelectric point, buoyant density and centrifugation conditions, stability against pH, temperature, UV light, gamma radiation and susceptibility to various chemical agents, including solvents and detergents. Possible inactivation, downstream and formulation conditions are given, including suitable buffers and some first ideas for quality-control methods. This information supports vaccine development and discussion with competent authorities during vaccine approval and is certainly related to drug-targeting strategies and hygienics. Several instructive tables are given, including the pI and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins in comparison. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in many regards, so information can often be derived. Both are unusually stable, but sensitive at their lipophilic membranes. However, since seemingly small differences can have strong effects, e.g., on immunologically relevant epitope settings, unevaluated knowledge transfer from SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2 cannot be advised. Published knowledge regarding downstream processes, formulations and quality assuring methods is, as yet, limited. However, standard approaches employed for other viruses and vaccines seem to be feasible, including virus inactivation, centrifugation conditions and the use of adjuvants.

Serum samples collected at day 60 were heated at 56°for 30 min and used for testing. Sera were diluted two-fold from 1 : 1 to 1: 64 and incubated with 100 TCID 50 of MLV (SARS) pseudotypes at 37°for 1 hr. Sera from PBS-immunized mice were used as negative controls. After incubation, 100 ll of serum/virus mixture was transferred from each well of the incubation plate to a 96-well cell culture plate containing Vero-E6 cells. Following 4 hr of incubation at 37°, serum/virus mixtures were replaced by cell culture medium. The plates were incubated at 37°with 5% CO 2 for 3 days, and the number of green fluorescence cells was counted under a fluorescence microscope. The neutralization effect was evaluated by calculating the percentage reduction of the green fluorescence cell number in serum sample wells infected with pseudotyped virus in comparison to that in wells with mock group serum samples infected with the same dose of pseudotyped virus.

In practice, the first test of the effectiveness of the new structures was the SARS pandemic of 2002/2003 -the first major emerging disease threat of the 21st century. After first appearing in the Chinese province of Guangdong in November 2002, it erupted as an international health threat in March 2003, when the WHO received notification and declared a global travel alert. Between March and the declaration on July 5 that the disease had been contained, SARS affected 8098 people, caused 774 deaths, brought international travel to a halt in entire regions, and cost $60 billion in gross expenditure and business losses to Asian countries alone. As retrospective studies have demonstrated, SARS presented many of the features that most severely expose the vulnerabilities of the global system: SARS is a respiratory disease capable of spreading from person to person without a vector; it has an asymptomatic incubation period of more than a week; it generates symptoms that closely resemble those of other diseases; it takes a heavy toll on caregivers and hospital staff; it readily spreads unobserved aboard aircraft; and it has a case fatality rate of 10%. At the time this new disease appeared, moreover, its causative pathogen (SARS-associated coronavirus) was unknown, and there was neither a diagnostic test nor a specific treatment. For all of these reasons, it dramatically confirmed the IOM's 1992 prediction that all countries were more vulnerable than ever to EIDs. SARS demonstrated no predilection for any region of the globe and was no respecter of prosperity, education, technology, or access to health care. Indeed, after its outbreak in China, SARS spread by airplane primarily to affluent cities such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Toronto, where it struck relatively prosperous travelers and their contacts, hospital workers, patients, and hospital visitors, rather than targeting the poor and the marginalized. More than half of the recognized cases occurred in well-equipped and technologically advanced hospital settings such as the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, the Scarborough Hospital in Toronto, and the Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore (31, 76, 77) .

Although it is known to be transmitted via droplets, alternative modes of transmission remain unknown. Transmission through infected ocular tissue or fluid has been a controversy. 1, 2 It is hypothesized that the nasolacrimal system can act as a conduit for viruses to travel from the upper respiratory tract to the eye. Hence, ocular tissue and fluid may represent a potential source of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we attempted to determine the possibility of transmission through tears by assessing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 with viral isolation and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. As patients were being monitored clinically via routine nasopharyngeal swabs, these results were compared with those of tears to understand further patterns of viral shedding.

The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new respiratory virus that has not been previously identified. It was reported first in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. This virus probably originated from an animal but at present, it can spread from human to human. At this moment, it is unclear how easily this virus can spread among people. Understanding the spreading mechanism is a very important issue in the control of its extensive global spread. Mathematical modelling is a necessary tool to understand the transmission mechanism. Various research studies have been presented to describe the virus, see Anderson and May (1979) , Diekmann and Heesterbeek (2000) and Xu and Ma (2009) . To control the spread of the virus, a dimensionless constant called the basic reproduction number R * is usually estimated to predict the number of infected from susceptible individuals in the future. Basically R * ≈ 3 − 4 for influenza, but it is much larger for measles so that R * ≈ 16 − 18, see Keeling and Rohani (2008) and Anderson and May (1998) . However, R * for COVID-19 is unclear, so in this work, we will apply the standard SIR model, Kermack and McKendrick (1927) to estimate R * and we will present an extension of the SIR model with two-time delays for infected individuals to obtain the best fit to the actual data using Monte Carlo Simulation. The transmission and recovery rates are approximated and a time delay effect is proposed. Finally, the infected ratio is defined and presented as an aid to monitoring control of the spread of the virus.

This short note provides estimates of the number of passengers that travel from China to all world airports in the period October 2019 - March 2020 on the basis of historical data. From this baseline we subtract the expected reduction in the number of passengers taking into account the temporary ban of some routes which was put in place since 23 January 2020 following the COVID-2019 Coronavirus outbreak. The results indicate a reduction of the number of passengers in the period January - March 2020 of -2.5%. This calculation considers only the complete closure of routes (not just direct flights) and not the reduction in the number of passengers on still active direct and indirect connections. At the moment of writing, with such partial information it is premature to quantify economic losses on the civil air transport and tourism industry. This note is meant to provide a baseline that be extended to all countries of origin and updated as more recent data will become available.

Cells regulate the activity and stability of various proteins by posttranslational modification. One of the most important modifications is the conjugation with the 76 amino acid and approximately 8 kDa protein ubiquitin (Ub) [48] (see Figure 1 for a schematic overview). Ubiquitination (also referred to as ubiquitylation) usually occurs via a linkage between the C-terminal carboxyl group (COOH) of the Ub protein with side chains of the target protein. The most prevalent types of Ub linkage occur between the COOH group of the C-terminal glycine of Ub and a thiol group (SH) of a cysteine residue, or the formation of an isopeptide bond between the COOH group of Ub and an εamino group (NH2) of a lysine residue present in the target protein. Less frequently, other amino acids (e.g., serine, threonine, and tyrosine) or the N-terminus are modified by Ub conjugation [49] . Ubiquitination is a concerted and stepwise process, catalyzed by the consecutive activities of a Ubactivating enzyme ('E1′), a Ub-conjugating enzyme ('E2′), and a Ub ligase ('E3′). The E1 enzyme activates Ub by ATP hydrolysis. Subsequently, the activated Ub is transferred from the E1 to the E2. From the E2, the Ub is linked to the target protein, usually catalyzed by a substrate-recognizing E3 ligase. The human genome encodes only a handful of enzymes with E1 activity [50, 51] , around 40 E2 enzymes, and several hundred E3 ligases [52] . The E1 as well the E2 enzymes and certain E3 ligases form thiol-linkages with Ub (structure: Ub-Gly-CO-S-Cys-enzyme), whereas Ub usually forms a covalent isopeptide bond with the target protein (structure: Ub-Gly-CO-NH-Lys-target). The situation is complicated by the fact that Ub harbors seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) and the N-terminus (M1) [53] , which can also be modified by The E1 enzyme activates Ub by ATP hydrolysis.

The situation is complicated by the fact that Ub harbors seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) and the N-terminus (M1) [53] , which can also be modified by subsequent ubiquitination events, resulting in a complex array of linear and branched, homotypic as well as heterotypic poly-Ub chains attached to different sites of various target proteins [54] . In addition to ubiquitination, Ub can also be subjected to other posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, neddylation, and ribosylation). Although the exact Ub code is far from being solved, it is clear that certain types of ubiquitination are mostly associated with defined down-stream events. For example, K48-and K11-linked poly-ubiquitinations usually cause the recognition by the proteasome and subsequent proteolytic degradation of the target protein, whereas K63-linked ubiquitination more often alters protein-protein interactions, resulting in a changed localization and/or activity of the modified protein without inducing degradation [55] . Since ubiquitination critically relies on very few E1 Ub activating enzymes, the pharmacologic inhibition of these E1s, using for example the drug PYR-41 [56] , blocks Ub conjugation to a large extent.

The WHO has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a public health emergency of international concern. 1 It was concluded that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes. It is transmitted from person to person who are in close contact (within about 1.8 meters). Furthermore, it is possible that the virus transmits by touching a surface or an object that has virus-containing respiratory droplets, and then touching the eyes, mouth or nose. 2 3 This mode of transmission may be important as coronavirus has been isolated from surfaces several days from dissemination. 4 As the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases increases, affected patients might frequently present to eye clinics or emergency departments. 5 When patients come to an ophthalmologist office for ocular examination, these patients have direct contact with examination equipment. A recent report by Lu and colleagues 3 suggested that ocular surfaces may be a potential mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and that ophthalmologists are highly prone to getting infected. Lai et al 6 reported infection control measures which were based on a three-level hierarchy of control measures: the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental control and administrative control. In addition, pandemics may potentially accelerate moves towards telemedicine, by which patients are treated by doctors and nurses remotely. 7 8 Our aim is to discuss the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on ophthalmology

First Corona case has been reported in Wuhan city of Hubei Province in south Chinea on december 31, 2019 as unidentified pneumonia [1, 2] . On 7 January 2020, Chinese government and the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified virus as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which belongs to the same virus family of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that outbroke also in South China in 2002-2003 [3] . Coronavirus is first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe [4] . it has four family members namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta. While alpha and beta coronaviruses apparently originate from bats, gamma and delta viruses originate from pigs and birds. Among these beta coronaviruses may cause severe disease and fatalities, whereas alpha-coronavirus cause asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-COVID-2) belongs to beta-coronaviruses and is closely related to the SARS-COVID-2 virus. SARS-COVID-2 is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough [5] . Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing [6] . People can be infected of COVID-19 disease from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. There is an increasing body of evidence to suggest that human-to-human transmission may be occurring during the asymptomatic incubation period of COVID-19, which has been estimated to be between 2 to 10 days [7] . On 30th January 2020, the WHO declared the Chinese outbreak of COVID-19 as pandemic [5] . All major counties have suspended all the international flights to reduce international traveller to the country for preventing COVID-19 diseases [6] . At present, no effective antiviral treatment or vaccine is available for COVID-19. The countries have taken strong measures to prohibit the virus's transmission, such as warning citizens from going outdoors, temporarily suspending the public transport between some big cities, and even taking quarantine for the main infected city. These unprecedented measures were expected to effectively stop the virus transmission and buy necessary time to deploy medical resources to the affected area [7] . The rapid spread of the COVID-19 may be due to multiple causes. One cause is the lacking of information transparency at the early stage of the epidemic outbreak. Releasing the epidemic information in a timely and accurate way is extremely important for the anti-epidemic response of the public. The authentic and transparent information could have prohibited the spread of the COVID-19 at the early stage. The other cause is the lacking of scientific diagnostic criterion for the COVID-19. Rapid developing exact testing techniques for a novel virus is very difficult. In fact, the symptoms of the COVID-19 are highly similar to those of flu. This aggravated the hardship of diagnosis. The last but not the least, the lacking of an epidemic warning and prediction system lost the opportunity to prohibit the epidemic spread at the initial stage. Mathematical modelling has gained more attention and awareness in epidemiology and the medical sciences [8, 9, 10, 11] . It has been used for cancer detection, segmentation and classification [12, 13, 14, 15] .These models are useful in the cases where disease dynamics are not unclear. It estimates the number of cases in worst and best-case scenarios. It is also helpful in estimating effect of preventive measures adopted against novel viruses such as COVID-19. One family of these models is the dynamical epidemic model called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. The SIR model originated from the study of the plague almost one hundred years ago. Tremendous advance has been achieved in dynamical epidemic model since mid-20th century. In recent decades, some realistic factors influencing the epidemic transmission were included in the classic SIR model, such as the model considering the incubation stage, the SEIRS model considering the population age and the population exposed to epidemic, and the SIS model including birth and death of the susceptible. Some dynamical models were also designed for specific epidemic. In the present manuscript, a novel mathematical model is being presented for estimating novel corona virus patients. The proposed model also considers Non-Pharmacological interventions (NPIs) such as Social distancing, closure of schools, universities and offices, avoidance of mass gatherings, community-wide containment etc [16, 17] . Also, the proposed model has been analysed with the general population, contacts of cases (Contact tracing, Surveillance, quarantine) and the cases themselves (Early Reporting, Isolation). The present work is organized as follows. The mathematical model for COVID-19 spread estimation is presented in section 2. Section 3 discusses data set used for validating proposed mathematical models. Results ad discussions are presented in section 4.

The 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was the largest in history, and occupationally acquired infections became a significant component of the epidemic in healthcare settings. [1] In the most affected country Sierra Leone, the confirmed Ebola incidence was 103-fold higher in healthcare workers (HCWs) than that in the general population. [2] The disease is most commonly spread through direct contact with blood or bodily fluids. To prevent transfer of Ebola virus from the patient to HCWs and vice versa, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a detailed guidance on the types of personal protective equipment (PPE) to be used and on the processes for donning and doffing PPE for all HCWs entering the room of a patient hospitalized with Ebola virus disease, first in October 2014 and then revised in August 2015. [3] The guidance for use in the United States recommends that the HCWs wear full body coverage PPE during patient care. After care is completed, the PPE items are removed by the HCW with double gloving to increase the safety margin, and alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) is recommended for disinfecting the gloves at multiple times during the PPE doffing in health care settings.

Since then, a novel coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has spread around the world, and the number of infected patients has been growing exponentially. We have known that the novel coronavirus has certain infectivity and a good affinity with human respiratory tract cells. It can also be transmitted from person to person. Thus, it is useful and urgent to predict the situation of this outbreak with mathematical modeling. Besides, students still stay at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Here we establish a model to predict the spread of COVID-19 and infer the most suitable return date for university students.

Definite evidence has shown that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could be transmitted from person to person, so far more than 1 700 bedside clinicians have been infected. A lot of respiratory treatments for critically ill patients are deemed as high-risk factors for nosocomial transmission, such as intubation, manual ventilation by resuscitator, noninvasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula, bronchoscopy examination, suction and patient transportation, etc, due to its high possibility to cause or worsen the spread of the virus. As such, we developed this consensus recommendations on all those high-risk treatments, based on the current evidence as well as the resource limitation in some areas, with the aim to reduce the nosocomial transmission and optimize the treatment for the COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Those recommendations include: (1)Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2)Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3)Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4)Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5)For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6)Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O(1 cmH(2)O=0.098 kPa); (7)In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8)Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9)For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10)PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11)Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.

Fear, prejudice, and discrimination can considerably impede anti-SARS-CoV-2 efforts [34] . A recent study of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from person to person through droplets and hand contact during an incubation period as well as on acute attack [2] . The closer we are to the truth, the farther we are from fear or panic. We think that open and transparent information on the outbreak to the public in China and the world, and administrative warning from authorities in every country are necessary to reduce fear and discrimination [34] . The health authorities should make the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and essential preventive measures to the public in China and the world openly and transparently in time through radio, television, newspaper, WeChat, and the internet, i.e. washing hands and wearing a mask. A 24-h free hotline 7 d a week should be set up for public to respond to all the questions and concerns, relive the worries and panic, and clear the rumor or misinformation. The public hospitals should open COVID-19 clinics and mental health clinics to consult with people to clear panic and misinformation. Likewise, government authorities in every country should cooperate with China to oppose stigma, language abuse and discrimination caused by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and strictly abide by disciplines and laws stress that our enemy is SARS-CoV-2 rather than the fear and stigma.

BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36–66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3–6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6–10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

Of the pathogens listed in Table 1 , those that cause smallpox, anthrax, and plague are particularly dangerous because they are easily spread from person to person via a respiratory route. An accidental, planned, or natural outbreak of one of these agents with respiratory mode of transmission, combined with frequent worldwide travel prevalent in today's society could lead to disastrous consequences. The potential for this to occur was evident during the recent SARS outbreak. Had the coronavirus responsible for causing SARS been more virulent, or more easily transmitted, the outcome of last year's outbreak could have been devastating.

SARS-CoV-2 is a viral disease that is caused by an nCoV. Currently, it is one of the global issues ever since it had first emerged and caused the outbreak in China. It is now spreading to different countries of the world. The disease can be transmitted from person to person through aerosol droplets, direct and indirect contact, and handling clinical cases by the medical practitioner, as well as in the laboratory setting. Also, it can be transmitted from bats to humans, which confirms its zoonotic importance. COVID can present various clinical signs that include high fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, diarrhea, myalgia or fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis. It can be diagnosed by clinical findings and laboratory tests including serology, viral isolation, and molecular techniques. COVID has great public health and economic impact. Since the disease has no specific treatment, proper measures should be taken to control and prevent the spread.

Studies support a transmission model in which a SARS-like CoV was transmitted from Rhinolophus bats to palm civets , which subsequently transmitted the palm civet-adapted virus to humans at local food markets in southern China .	As the CTR of the S 1 subunit contains the protein RBD for most CoVs, also mutations in this part of S have been associated with changes in the virus' tropism. Perhaps the most well-known example of viral cross-species transmission involves the SARS-CoV. Studies support a transmission model in which a SARS-like CoV was transmitted from Rhinolophus bats to palm civets, which subsequently transmitted the palm civet-adapted virus to humans at local food markets in southern China . According to this model, SARS-like viruses adapted to both the palm civet and human host, which was reflected in the rapid viral evolution observed for these viruses within these species . Two-amino acid substitutions within the RBD were elucidated that are of relevance for binding to the ACE2 proteins of palm civets and humans (Li et al., 2005b Qu et al., 2005) . From these studies it appears that due to strong conservation of ACE2 between mammalian species only a few amino acid alterations within the RBD are needed to change coronavirus host species tropism. Indeed serial passage of SARS-CoVs in vitro or in vivo can rapidly lead to adaptation to new host species (Roberts et al., 2007) . SARS-like viruses isolated from bats displayed major differences including a deletion in the ACE2 RBM compared to human SARS-CoV (Drexler et al., 2010; Ren et al., 2008) and as a consequence were unable of using human ACE2 as an entry receptor (Becker et al., 2008) . However, recently a novel SARSlike BtCoV was identified, which could use ACE2 of Rhinolophus bats, palm civets as well as of humans as a functional receptor . These findings not only provide further evidence that bats are indeed the natural reservoir for SARS-like CoVs, but also that these bat coronaviruses can directly include human ACE2 in their receptor repertoire. The detection of sequences of SARS-CoV-like viruses in palm civets and raccoon dogs (Guan et al., 2003; Tu et al., 2004) therefore probably reflects the unusually wide host range of these viruses. A similar promiscuous receptor usage is also observed for MERS-CoV which binds to DPP4 of many species (Barlan et al., 2014; Eckerle et al., 2014; Falzarano et al., 2014; M€ uller et al., 2012; van Doremalen et al., 2014) as indicated earlier.

Conclusions: Collection of oral specimens is less invasive and may be more acceptable in certain situations. A single, acute specimen is adequate for diagnosis by RT-PCR. Our specimens, however, were collected late in the course of illness which affected the sensitivity of RT-PCR's. Earlier specimens may give a better yield. A study in paediatric patients is needed to assess the value of these methods for primary dengue infection. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the proportion of seropositives against Hantaviruses among healthy blood donors. Methods: 1607 volunteer donors were recruited by the institute of transfusion medicine, representing the demographic situation in the Tyrol regarding gender and residence. Sera were tested for IgG with a commercially available ELISA. Positive samples were confirmed by a commercially available dot blot which was also used for identification of the serovar. Setting: The study area comprises North Tyrol (Austria, north of the main ridge of the Alps), South Tyrol (Italy) and East Tyrol (Austria, both south of the main ridge of the Alps). South Tyrol belongs to the catchment area of the Etsch river, which drains into the Adriatic, while North-and East Tyrol are part of the catchment area of the Danube, which drains to the black sea. Results: None of 617 samples from the Italian part of the study area yielded a positive result, wherein 7 of 988 donors of the Austrian part turned out to be seropositive. Two patients were positive for Hantaan, 3 patients were positive for Puumala, one patient was positive for Dobrava and one patient had antibodies against Hantaan and Dobrava. Only one of those patients reported extensive travelling abroad. Conclusions: Evidence was found for the occurrence of Hantaviruses in the Austrian part of the region covering the catchment area of the Danube, but not in the Italian part of the study area covering the catchment area of the Etsch river. Seropositivity to Hantaviruses differs by hydrogeographic areas. Objectives: Canine coronavirus (CCoV) is an enveloped, singlestranded RNA virus, belonging to group I coronaviruses within the family Coronaviridae. Two different CCoV genotypes have been recognised, that are designated CCoVs type I and type II on the basis of their genetic relatedness to feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) type I and type II, respectively. CCoV is usually responsible for mild, self-limiting infections restricted to the enteric tract. We report the molecular characterisation of a pantropic variant of CCoV that caused fatal disease in pups. Methods: CCoV type II strain CB/05 was isolated from an outbreak of fatal disease affecting seven dogs housed in a pet shop in Apulia region, Italy and characterised by fever, lethargy, inappetance, vomiting, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, neurological signs, and severe lesions in the parenchymatous organs. In all tissues, CCoV antigen was detected by immunoistochemistry and CCoV type II RNA was identified by genotype-specific realtime RT-PCR. The 3' end of the genome of strain CB/05 was determined by amplification of seven partially overlapping fragments. The PCR-amplified products were subjected to direct sequencing and the obtained nucleotide (nt) sequences were assembled and analysed using the BioEdit software package and the NCBI's and EMBL's analysis tools. GenBank accession number DQ112226 was assigned to the sequenced 8.7-kb fragment. The inferred amino acid sequences (aa) were compared to the analogous proteins available in the online databases. Results: The structural proteins S, E, M, N of strain CB/05 displayed a high degree of aa identity to the cognate ORFs of CCoV type II, although the S protein showed the highest identity to type II FCoVs. While the nonstructural protein (nsp) 3a had the same length of known CCoVs, the nsp3b was 49-aa shorter than expected due to the presence of a 38-nt deletion at position 4704 and to a frame shift in the sequence downstream the deletion that introduced an early stop codon. Conclusions: Association of strain CB/05 to a severe, fatal disease of dogs, together with virus isolation from organs with remarkable lesions, strongly suggests that this virus has changed the tropism, acquiring the ability to spread from the enteric tract to the internal organs. By sequence analysis of the viral genome, the only striking change was the truncated form of nsp3b, but the role of the deletion in the ORF3b in determining the patho-biological change deserves more in-depth investigation. Objectives: To perform a surveillance study for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-like virus in non-caged wild animals from the wild of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Methods: From summer 2004 to spring 2005, 127 bats, 60 rodents and 20 monkeys from 11 locations in HKSAR were captured. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs and blood samples were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-like virus RNA by RT-PCR using conserved primers targeted to a 440-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (pol) gene. The complete genome of the SARS-CoV-like virus from bats (bat-SARS-CoV) was sequenced using RNA extracted from three anal swabs of three bats as template. Phylogenetic tree construction was performed using neighbor-joining method with GrowTree using Jukes-Cantor correction. Prediction of signal peptides and cleavage sites was performed using SignalP, transmembrane domains using TMpred and TMHMM, potential N-glycosylation sites using ScanProsite and protein family analysis using PFAM and InterProScan. Antibodies were detected using a recombinant bat-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein enzyme immunoassay and neutralization assay for human SARS-CoV. Results: We identified a coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV (bat-SARS-CoV) from 23 (39%) of 59 anal swabs of wild Chinese horseshoe bats by RT-PCR. Sequencing and analysis of three bat-SARS-CoV genomes from samples collected at different dates showed that bat-SARS-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV from humans and civets. Phylogenetic analysis showed that bat-SARS-CoV formed a distinct cluster with SARS-CoV as group 2b coronaviruses, distantly related to known group 2 coronaviruses. Most differences between the bat-SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV genomes were observed in the spike gene, ORF 3 and ORF 8, which are the regions where most variations were also observed between human and civet SARS-CoV genomes. In addition, the presence of a 29-bp insertion in ORF 8 of bat-SARS-CoV genome, not in most human SARS-CoV genomes, suggests that it has a common ancestor with civet SARS-CoV. Antibody against recombinant bat-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein was detected in 84% of Chinese horseshoe bats using an enzyme immunoassay. Neutralizing antibody to human SARS-CoV was also detected in those with lower viral loads. Conclusion: Our data support the existence of SARS-CoV-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats in HKSAR. Noroviruses are genetically heterogeneous and form at least 27 genotypes within 5 genogroups, GI, GII, GIII, GIV, and GV, based on the capsid genes. Human NoVs cause an estimated 23 million cases of illness annually in the United States alone and >90% of nonbacterial epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide. Porcine calicivirus have been found to be genetically similar to human GII NoVs or to sapoviruses but calicivirus RNA has been detected at low frequency by RT-PCR in adults or fattening pigs. The close genetic relationships between human and porcine NoVs raise public health concerns regarding their potential for zoonotic transmission and as a potential source of new epidemic human strains. Methods: A total of 46 faecal samples of nursing and weaning piglets with enteritis were collected during 2003-2005 in porcine herds in Italy. An additional 44 samples were include in the analysis, that had been collected during a rotavirus (RV) surveillance study in 2003-2005, all which tested positive to RV by electron microscopy and by RT-PCR. Viral RNA was extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate/glass milk method to eliminate enzyme inhibitors. Primer pair Con2-Con3, targeted to the VP4 outer capsid protein, was used for RV detection. A degenerated version of primer pair 289/290 was used for NV detection, that targets a conserved region in the RNApolymerase. Results: NoV RNA was detected in 20/46 of the screened samples, while RVs were detected in 24/46 samples. Mixed infections NoV+RV were found in 10 samples. Screening of the 44 RV positive samples allowed detection of 15 mixed infections with NoVs. Conclusions: In previous investigations NoVs were detected in 4 of 1,017 normal slaughtered pigs in Japan, in 2 of 100 pooled pig faecal samples of 3-to 9-month-old fattening pigs in the Netherlands and in 6 out of 274 healthy adult and finisher pigs in the United States. Interestingly, in this study a high rate of positivity to NoVs (35/90) was found in nursing and weaning piglets with diarrhoea, a finding that may suggest a higher frequency of infection by NoV in young pigs or an association between NoV infection and occurrence of enteric disease. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that NoVs are common in porcine herds in Italy and provide new insights into the ecology of NoVs.

The SIR model is one of the simplest models to predict properties of how a disease spreads, for example total number of infected or the duration of an epidemic. The population is first divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics [15] . The model consists of three compartments: S for the number of susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number of recovered or deceased (or immune) individuals. This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human. During an epidemic, the number of susceptible individual falls rapidly as more of them are infected and thus enter the infectious and recovered compartments. Each member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to recovered. JP Morgan used a model based on SIR to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic curve in Malaysia [16] . The estimation is based on the potential size of the group that initially interacts with the infected group (i.e., group needs to get the virus test) to be around ~0.2% of the total population based on the total size of the test group in China's Hubei and South Korea, which is about 0.1 and 0.7% of the total population, respectively. The secondary infection rate (R0) was adopted based on infection parameters used in China (2) and South Korea (1.9) where a country would face a doubling of infection process in every 5-7 days in the early acceleration stage. Due to several containment measures and lower population density of Malaysia (96 people per sq. km of land area vs. Japan/ Korea: 347/ 212 according to World Bank), they set 1.7 as the initial setting of R0. Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team modified an individual-based simulation model for pandemic influenza planning by [17] to explore scenarios for COVID-19 in Great Britain. For their model, they assumed an incubation period of 5.1 days, infectiousness to occur from 12 hours prior to the onset of symptoms for those that are symptomatic and from 4.6 days after infection in those that are asymptomatic with an infectiousness profile over time that results in a 6.5-day mean generation time. They used R0=2.4 based on fits to the early growth-rate of the epidemic in Wuhan and symptomatic individuals as 50% more infectious than asymptomatic individuals. On recovery from infection, individuals are assumed to be immune to re-infection in the short term. In addition, Pueyo [18] uses the epidemic calculator provided by Goh [19] to predict the effect of control measures on spread of infection in the United States and how it will affect their healthcare services. Chen et al. proposed a time-delay dynamic system based on five compartments: external suspected people, infected people, confirmed people, isolated people, and cured people [20] . They also added external sources such as, spread rate, latent period, delay period, exposed people, and cured rate to describe the trend of COVID-19 outbreak.

Enveloped virus entry can occur directly at the cell surface after binding to the receptor or after internalization via endocytosis with fusion taking place in the endosomal compartment. Fusion of viral membranes with host membranes is driven by large conformational changes of the spike protein. Over time, coronaviruses have modified their spike proteins, leading to the diversity of triggers used to activate their fusion. These conformational changes can be initiated by receptor binding but may need additional triggers such as pH acidification or proteolytic activation. The mechanisms of coronavirus entry are complex and differ between coronavirus species and strains. For example, depending on the MHV strain, fusion can occur directly at the cell surface after receptor binding or after endocytosis. JHM strain MHV-4 fuses at neutral pH, but the virus was also detected in endosomal vesicles [54] . It is likely that MHV-4 is capable of entering directly at the cell surface or through the endosomal pathway. The choice of entry mechanism may depend on the cell type. In both cases, fusion is solely triggered by receptor binding. Indeed, it has been shown that incubation of JHM spike protein with a soluble form of the receptor CEACAM1 induces modifications in S hydrophobicity and conformational change of the S2 region [55] [56] [57] . In addition, JHM is able to spread from DBT cells to BHK cells that do not express the MHV receptor. Incubation with soluble receptor increases this receptor-independent propagation [58] . The capacity of the spike protein to fuse at neutral pH relies on the properties of the fusion machinery. A variant of MHV-4 isolated from persistently infected cells requires low pH exposure for productive infection. The difference of pH requirement for fusion between the mutant and the wild type virus was attributed to three point mutations in the heptad repeat regions [59] . Concerning MHV-A59 entry mechanisms, contradictory results have been reported. Qui et al. reported that parental strain of MHV-A59 was insensitive to lysomotropic agent whereas the recombinant strain containing the MHV-2 spike protein relies on low pH for entry [60] . Indeed, MHV-2 entry requires low-pH-activated endosomal proteases (cathepsin B and L) and, if a cleavage site is introduced in MHV-2 spike protein, virus entry no longer requires these proteases; these data are in favor of pH-independent fusion induced by receptor binding. Eifart et al. challenged this scenario. Combining different approaches of infection and microscopy, the authors have shown that MHV-A59 infection is sensitive to lysomotropic agent and that the virus is internalized allowing initiation of infection, suggesting that pH acidification is required to trigger viral fusion [61] . It is likely that receptor binding is a key determinant of MHV entry, however the requirement for an additional fusion trigger remains unclear. For MHV-2, the endocytosis mechanism was further characterized: the virus is internalized by a clathrin-dependent pathway that does not depend on the eps15 adaptor [62] .

We describe a patient who is second child of consanguineous healthy parents from Turkey. He was born after 37 weeks of gestation with normal birth parameters (2850 g, 51 cm, OFC 32 cm). At the age of three months atypical eye movements became apparent. Psychomotor development was delayed from the beginning, he presented with hypotonia and later developed ataxia. An abnormal breathing pattern was not noticed. An abnormal MRI with hypoplasia of the cerebella vermis at the age of 21 months and the clinical signs described above led to a clinical diagnosis of Joubert syndrome. At that time no diagnostic testing was available. He returned to the Outpatient Clinic of the Institute of Human Genetics at the age of 22 years having developed retinopathy in the meantime. His height was below average (~3 cm, <P3) but still within his family's range. Aside from the known irregular eye movements he showed nail hypoplasia of the thumbs, and small hands and feet. He was working at a sheltered workshop. The year before, the Pediatric Department of the University Hospital Heidelberg had initiated testing of 7 of the by then known genes causative for Joubert with no mutation being found (NPHP1, TMEM216, CC2D2A, MKS3, RP-GRIP1L, OFD-1 and MKS4). The gene associated with Joubert syndrome type 3 (OMIM #608629) was not included though. With the external MRI not being available at that time we decided to first perform chromosome and array analyseis. The conventional chromosome analysis was without pathological findings. Subsequent array analysis by Affymetrix® Cytoscan HD Oligo/SNP showed an 11 kb homozygous deletion in 6q23.3 within the AHI1 gene, the gene for Joubert syndrome type 3. The deletion encompasses exon 10 to 13 which includes parts of the WD-repeats (tryptophan-aspartic acid (W-D) dipeptide) on the protein level. The homozygous deletion was confirmed by MLPA in the patient and both parents identified as heterozygous carriers. So far, alterations in AHI1 leading to Joubert syndrome comprise homozygous point mutations or small heterozygous deletion/duplications in combination with a second pathogenic mutation. So we here present the first case of a large homozygous deletion in the AHI1 gene, being causative for Joubert syndrome type 3. We conclude that in un-A review of the literature showed that the few patients with a sSMC of the pericentric regions of chromosome 8 described in literature show early feeding problems, developmental delay, delay in acquired language, difficulties in social skills, difficulties in attention and activity levels or autistic-like behavior. The facial dysmorphic features were not specific. Multiple hemangiomas have been reported in some cases. West syndrome or seizures have not been reported so far. The phenotype of our patient is consistent with the literature data, however there are no patients with a sSMC showing the same breakpoints reported so far. Especially due to the mosaicism and the rare number of patients described in the literature, no precise clinical prognosis for this patient was possible. The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by reprogramming of adult somatic cells (e. g. skin fibroblasts) represents a novel technology for studying disease mechanisms. For generation of iPSCs several reprogramming methods, including the use of integrating vectors and non-integrating vectors, have been developed. Since genetic abnormalities can arise during the reprogramming process, genetic quality assurance is indispensable. The aim of this analysis was to compare the genetic stability of iPSCs generated using either a DNA-integrating or a DNA-non-integrating reprogramming technique in order to reveal possible method-specific differences. We studied iPSCs derived from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. To monitor the genetic stability, we investigated copy number variants (CNVs) in addition to conventional chromosome analyses in iPSCs of ten PD patients and six healthy control individuals. Using high-resolution chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), we monitored the formation of relevant CNVs during reprogramming to pluripotency by comparing fibroblasts and iP-SCs of the respective individual. To date, fibroblast cultures of all 16 selected probands as well as 47 retroviral reprogrammed iPSC clones and eight Sendai-viral reprogrammed iPSC clones were analyzed. Aneuploidies were detected in three fibroblast cultures (19%), in five retroviral iPSC clones (11%), and in none of the Sendai iPSC clones. De novo CNVs were identified in 33 retroviral iPSCs (70%) -19 clones showed one (40%), nine clones showed two (19%), four clones showed three (9%), and one clone showed four newly arisen CNVs (2%). In seven of eight Sendai clones, de novo CNVs were detected (88%). Two de novo CNVs were identified in three clones (38%), three CNVs in two clones (25%), four in one clone (13%), and even six de novo CNVs were detected in one clone (13%). Additionally, a mosaic gain of the whole long arm of one chromosome 9 was identified in one Sendai clone. Only 14 of the retroviral reprogrammed clones (30%) as well as one Sendai reprogrammed clone (13%) showed no newly arisen CNVs. The CNVs were between 106 kb and 6.4 Mb in length in retroviral clones and between 106 kb and 926 kb in Sendai clones. Because almost all CNVs contained genes, including genes involved in neurodevelopment and transcriptional regulation, a biological relevance seems highly probable and changes in cell phenotype cannot be excluded. Since iPSCs and cells derived thereof -independent of reprogramming methods -often contain aberrations not detected by standard chromosomal analysis, our findings highlight the importance of high resolution CMA procedures. In spite of differences in the analyzed number of clones, our results indicate more and larger CNVs in Sendai clones than in retroviral reprogrammed clones.

The healthy mother possesses the insertion ins(12;4) (q24.33;q24q28), the simultaneous resection of the 12q2?3-12q24.3 material and generation of the additional ring chromosome with this material. During meiosis a normal chromosome 4, the derivative chromosome 12 and the ring chromosome were passed on to the son leading to the unbalanced karyotype as described above. Further analysis with pan-centromeric probes and immunohistochemistry with an antibody against CENP-A might confirm the existence of a neocentromere on the ring chromosome which was meiotically transmitted from the mother to the son. The mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) kinase is the most important regulator of local dendritic and presynaptic protein translation in the brain. It has been shown to fundamentally influence AMPA receptor activity by shifting GluA1 to GluA2 balance and to control the synthesis of several proteins involved in synaptic function and plasticity. Both, loss and gain of mTOR activity lead to significant disturbances of brain homeostasis and neuronal function resulting in intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, autism and behavioural alterations. In order to analyse mechanisms of homeostatic regulation of mTOR-dependent synaptic function we are using a heterozygous Tsc2 knockout (KO) mouse model for tuberous sclerosis (TS). TSC2 (together with TSC1) is part of a complex that inhibits the mTOR kinase. Mutations in either of the two genes result in increased mTOR activity and upregulated downstream signalling and are causative for autosomal dominant TS. It had been shown previously that mTOR hyperactivity leads to a set point shift and significantly influences neuronal homeostasis by altering cell excitability and E/I balance in heterozygous Tsc2KO animals. According to these studies we hypothesize that this shift significantly leads to synaptic connectivity and plasticity as well as network alternations that result in progressive development of cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy, autism and behavioural alterations over time in TS. We have established a behaviour battery, which consists of a novel object recognition test (NORT), a morris water maze test (MWM) and an evaluation of nest building and social interaction to study social behaviour and cognitive performance in heterozygous Tsc2KO mice in different age groups. Interestingly we found that, while two months old animals do not show any alterations, three to four months old animals develop significant disturbances in social behaviour in the social interaction test and in nest building. Furthermore, we could show significant changes in cognitive performance of seven to eight months old heterozygous Tsc2KO mice in the NORT compared to three to four months old heterozygous Tsc2KO animals. These data show that the TS phenotype builds up on shifts of the E/I balance that develop at a very early stage. Pharmacological intervention with E/I balance is a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent brain damage caused by congenital hyperexcitability and homeostatic dysfunction. clear cases of a Joubert phenotype an array-CGH is recommended besides sequencing to clarify the molecular basis of the phenotype. Recently, a new syndrome of intellectual disability (ID) with dysmorphisms due to deletions within the chromosomal band 3q26.32 harboring the TBL1XR1 gene was described. Additionally, a specific point mutation in TBL1XR1 causes Pierpont syndrome, a distinct mental retardation syndrome. We report four patients in which array-CGH analysis and real-time quantitative PCR of genomic DNA revealed TBL1XR1 microduplication. Adjacent genes were not affected. The microduplication was verified as de novo by real-time PCR of parental DNA in one patient. The other three cases occurred in two generations of a second, unrelated family. We compare the remarkably similar clinical findings in TBL1XR1 microdeletion, point mutation and microduplication cases and expand the TBL1XR1-associated phenotypic spectrum. Among others, intellectual disability, hearing loss and autism spectrum disorders are common features of TBL1XR1-associated diseases. Our clinical observations add to the increasing evidence of TBL1XR1's role in physiological brain development and simultaneously demonstrate that opposing genetic disease mechanisms affecting TBL1XR1 can lead to similar ID phenotypes. In conclusion, the observed phenotypic overlap indicates that this novel microduplication is a genomic sister-disorder to the 3q26.32 microdeletion syndrome. Neocentromere formation has been reported in more than 100 small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC). Here we report the formation of a putative neocentromere within a supernumerary ring chromosome derived from chromosome 12 in a five year old patient with generalized developmental delay, microcephaly and hexadactyly. Chromosomal analysis (GTG-banding, resolution 550 bands) of the boy showed an aberrant karyotype with a derivative chromosome 12 demonstrating additional chromosome 4 specific material inserted into the distal part of the long arm (ins(12;4)(q24.33;q24q28)), a simultaneous deletion of the chromosomal region 12q2?3-q24.33 on the same homolog and an additional supernumerary small marker chromosome, presumably a ring chromosome in all metaphases tested. In parallel, Array-CGH was performed and revealed a gain of 22.6 Mb in chromosomal region 4q24-q28.1 without a detectable imbalance of chromosome 12 material within the limits of the method (400k array). FISH analysis with wcp probes and telomeric probes for chromosomes 4 and 12 confirmed the interstitial insertion of chromosome 4 material into the long arm of the derivative chromosome 12. The marker chromosome stained completely with a wcp12 probe but centromere probes for chromosomes 4 and 12 were both negative suggesting the formation of a neocentromere within region 12q2?3q24.33. In total, the complex rearrangement resulted in a partial trisomy 4q in the boy as a presumable explanation for the phenotype. The mother has experienced one abortion and the parents have two more children who show a normal development so far. Both parents were karyotyped. The analysis of the father was normal (46,XY). Konventional chromosomal analysis of the in FLVCR1 have previously been linked to vision impairment and posterior column ataxia in humans, but not to HSAN. Using fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with sensory neurodegeneration, we here show that the FLVCR1-mutations reduce heme export activity, enhance oxidative stress and increase sensitivity to programmed cell death. Our data link heme metabolism to sensory neuron maintenance and suggest that intracellular heme overload causes early-onset degeneration of pain-sensing neurons in humans. Autosomal-dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (FH, OMIM 143890) is one of the most common genetic diseases with an estimated prevalence of 1: 200 to 1: 500. Three major genes have been associated with the disease: low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9). We have recently published data on the mutation spectrum in these three genes in about 200 FH patients from Germany, however, this screen for mutations was negative in about 40% of the cases. STAP1 (signal transducing adaptor family member 1) was recently suggested to be the fourth FH gene. We therefore screened the STAP1 gene for disease causing variants in a group of 70 FH patients negative for mutations in the three established FH genes by direct DNA sequencing (Sanger). The newly identified variants will be presented including a phenotype-genotype correlation. Phenotype: We present a 13-year-old girl with developmental delay, craniofacial anomalies, congenital eye anomalies (4.5 dpt), short stature and behavioral disorder with auto-aggressions. Preliminary examinations (array-CGH analysis, karyotyping, diagnostic of metabolism, EEG, cMRT, sequencing of SRCAP-gene) revealed normal results. Methods: In course of the MIDAS-Project, we sequenced the index patient and her healthy, non-consanguineous parents on a NextSeq500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) to perform a trio analysis. For library preparation we used an enzymatic fragmentation approach. Exome capture was performed with a SureSelect Human All Exon kit V6 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), targeting coding exons and conserved splicing sites of over 20.000 genes. The library of the index patient was sequenced with a 285-fold mean coverage as 151-bp paired-end reads. 94% of the target region were covered 20-fold or higher. Data analysis and variant evaluation was done using the CLC Genomic Workbench 9.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and annotations from commercial as well as public databases. Results: The trio analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from the index patient and her parents revealed 58 variants. We identified the disease-causing de novo ADNP mutation c.2188C>T (p.Arg730*, ADNP), resulting in the introduction of a stop codon in exon 5/5 and truncation of the corresponding protein. Both of the parents did not carry this mutation. ADNP is part of the ATP-dependent BAF chromatin-remodeling P-MonoG-137 The challenge to insert Costello syndrome causing HRAS mutations into human keratinocytes using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology. L. Brandenstein, K. Kutsche, G. Rosenberger University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Germline missense mutations in the HRAS gene cause Costello syndrome, a rare developmental disorder characterized by a typical facial gestalt, postnatal growth deficiency, intellectual disability, and predisposition to malignancies as well as skeletal, cardiac and dermatological abnormalities. The molecular pathophysiology caused by heterozygous HRAS gain of function mutations has been analysed in various tissues and cell types, however, up to date the molecular basis for cutaneous manifestations in Costello syndrome is largely unknown. To address this question in an appropriate model system, permanent human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells carrying Costello syndrome-associated mutations in the endogenous HRAS gene should be generated by using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Double strand breaks induced by Cas9 can be repaired in two ways: the error-prone non-homologous end-joining pathway for the generation of knockout models or the homology directed repair pathway, which allows precise editing. The latter enables the introduction of specific point mutations into a cell line by using a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) as repair template. However, we found that this is a very rare event and its efficiency depends on various factors including used cell line, selected guide RNA, length and amount of ssDNA and also Cas9 variant. Nonetheless, by using Cas9 wildtype, we could insert the disease-associated c.35G>T (p.G12V) mutation into genomic HRAS both in HaCaT cells (8 positive clones out of 800) and HEK cells (3 positive clones out of 15). In contrast, using the Cas9 nickase protein variant that prevents off target effects, did not result in positive clones. Taken together, in 10 months of working with CRISPR/ Cas9 we gradually gained experience with many problems and pitfalls of this technology and, finally, now we are able to introduce point mutations in cell lines. Next, we will use the mutant HaCaT cell line to gain deeper insight into the function of HRAS for epidermal homeostasis and its deregulation in Costello syndrome.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are neurotropic [3] and SARS-CoV particles have been detected in neurons of the human brain [4, 5] . Given the high level of genetic homology of CoVs, which also share many other characteristics, it is also likely that SARS-CoV-2 may gain access to the central nervous system, where it can induce neuronal injury. The peripheral invasion of nerves by SARS-CoV-2 is further suggested by the occurrence of anosmia and ageusia in more than 5% of a population of 214 COVID-19 people [6] . From the peripheral nerves the virus may have access to the central nervous system via trans-synaptic transfer, a possibility documented for other coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo [7] . Recent experimental evidence demonstrates that a human CoV strain, HCoV OC43, can travel from the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulb, then spreading to the piriform cortex and ultimately to the brainstem, via both passive diffusion and axonal transport [8, 9] . Alternatively or in additionwhich would increase central nervous system vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 diffusionthe virus may travel retrogradely along the vagus nerve, which innervates many of the visceral organs that can be invaded by the virus beyond the lungs, such as the heart and the gastrointestinal tract. Once in the vagal nerve endings, retrograde axonal transport may grant access to the brainstem.

Our findings implicate the superficial ocular surface epithelium and as an additional entry route for SARS-CoV-2, which may exploit the mucus rich ocular surface to make its way into the respiratory tract via the naso-lacrimal system and/or blood vessels. Our data also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may exploit inflammatory driven upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to enhance infection in the ocular surface. The evidence presented herein has profound implications on provision of eye protective equipment for all healthcare professionals looking after patients suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive, particularly in the ophthalmology clinics and more importantly the development of "eye drops", which can be used by everyone as a prophylactic measure to stop viral entry through the ocular surface epithelium. This is particularly important for elderly and 'at risk' groups currently in isolation, but face the need for regular contact with asymptomatic carers looking after them and the risk of a potential second outburst next winter and/or when the "social distancing" and isolation measures are relaxed. While this manuscript was under preparation, a clinical case report of a Chinese COVID-19 patient who travelled from Wuhan to Italy and who presented with nonproductive cough, sore throat, coryza, and bilateral conjunctivitis was 15 described 40 . Viral RNA was detected in ocular swabs from day 3 to day 21; moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected again in the ocular swab at day 27, five days after it became undetectable. The viral RNA was present at lower levels than in the nasal swabs, which suggests a sustained replication in the conjunctiva. Together these findings suggest early but prolonged detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swabs and the possibility that ocular mucosa may be not only a site of virus entry but also a source of infection.

SARS-CoV-2 has 96% of the genome identity of a bat SARS-like coronavirus [5] . Presumably, this virus and its predecessors originated from animals and mutated or recombined in a fashion that permitted it to infect, cause disease, and pass from person to person. The knowledge that the health of humans, animals and of the environment is all interconnected dates back to the ancient world. However, it is only recently, and after evidence that an animal virus could give origin to a devastating human virus (avian influenza, West Nile, Ebola, MERS-CoV and many others zoonotic pathogens), that international health organizations invested on surveillance and animal studies, including livestock, pets and wildlife [6] . Transmission across species and globalization, with the consequent impact of the latter on transcontinental commerce and ease of international travel, makes any nation and any of us susceptible to an infectious disease, new or old, that can spread rapidly, disrespecting borders and becoming global in no time. Furthermore, with the explosion of the world's population, the opportunity for transfer of a microbe from one human to another is higher than ever in history. The majority of the world's population now lives in urban settings, leading to close contacts conducive to the spread of infection. Increase in life expectancy has also amplified the proportion of elderly and of individuals with chronic conditions and/or cancer, all at greater risk of infection and its sometime fatal complications. Last but not least, humans place themselves and others at potential risk of infection through various behaviours [7] .

Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases continue to challenge human health. The reported incidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic disease is increasing in many parts of the world. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged 17 years ago (Drosten et al., 2003) . In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) crossed species barriers to infect humans (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) and was effectively transmitted from person to person, leading to a pneumonia outbreak first reported in Wuhan, China (Guan et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b) . This virus causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with influenza-like symptoms ranging from mild disease to severe lung injury and multi-organ failure, eventually leading to death, especially in older patients with other co-morbidities. The WHO has declared that COVID-19 is a public health emergency of pandemic proportions (https://www.who.int/). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not only an enormous burden to public health but has already markedly affected civil societies and the global economy.

The route via free infectious virus particles (illustrated in Fig. 8A ) plays an important role for long distance virus spread to different tissues within an organism and for spread among other hosts between the same or other species. However, many viruses use different pathways without the need of free infectious virus diffusing through the extracellular environment. This mode of viral spread can be advantageous for persistent infections, such as BDV infection, in order to evade the defense by the host. Such mechanisms of virus transmission to neighbouring cells were recently demonstrated with influenza virus and parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) (Roberts et al., 2015) . The observation that fusion-active BDV-GP is essential for the dissemination via cell-cell contacts raises the question of how exactly GP mediates spread in the absence of cellfree virus. It has previously been hypothesized that BDV is transmitted as non-enveloped vRNPs (Gosztonyi et al., 1993; Cubitt and de la Torre, 1994a; Clemente and de la Torre, 2007) (illustrated in Fig. 8C) , and a recent study showed the trafficking of viral components through contact sites between cells (Charlier et al., 2013) . This cell-to-cell transfer of the core infectious viral machinery (RNP complex and polymerase) could occur through intercellular connections (tunnelling nanotubes) (Gerdes and Carvalho, 2008; Sherer and Mothes, 2008) in the absence of a fusion-mediating viral glycoprotein (Fig. 8C) , or through GP-induced, local fusion events that would permit vRNPs to directly travel from infected cells to uninfected cells. Such a glycoprotein-mediated transmission via microfusion has been suggested for the spread of measles and canine distemper virus in neurons (Young and Rall, 2009; Wyss-Fluehmann et al., 2010) . This mode of cell-to-cell spread not only facilitates rapid viral dissemination but may also promote immune evasion and influence disease outcome. Alternatively, BDV could be transmitted through short-lived viral particles, which bud at close contact sites between cells and immediately bind and enter adjacent cells in a GP-dependent manner (Fig. 8B) , or are transported either in vesicles or as surface-attached virus on the surface of tunnelling nanotubes, which enter the cell through GP-dependent fusion. Such a mode of transport would be compatible with the absence of cell-free BDV in the brain and has been observed for other neurotropic viruses, e.g. during the transsynaptic passage of rabies virus (Etessami et al., 2000) . Interestingly, in BDV-infected rat brains, uninfected neurons adjacent to BDV-infected ones harbour viruspositive dot-like structures at the outer plasma membrane of their perikaryon, an observation that could substantiate former hypotheses. The transmission pathways described earlier either depend on a fusion-mediating viral glycoprotein ( Fig. 8A and B) or need no viral glycoprotein (Fig. 8C ). However, a lack of detectable cleaved glycoprotein per se does not necessarily exclude glycoproteinmediated virus transmission as was shown recently for coronaviruses, where the cleavage of the glycoprotein S occurs shortly before the fusion of viral and lysosomal membranes (Burkard et al., 2014) . Further ultrastructural studies of the events at contact sites between infected and uninfected cells would be helpful to clarify the detailed mechanism of how GP mediates cell-cell transmission of BDV; however, the extremely low BDV production during infection might render such experiments nearly impossible and beyond the scope of this study.

The control of the route of transmission is another effective means of epidemic control. Infections of healthcare workers and family clusters suggest that 2019-nCoV has the ability to spread from human to human. Although the seafood market has been closed, the number of confirmed cases continues to gradually increase ( Fig. 1 B) . This further supports the conclusion that this virus can spread by human-to-human contact. Previous research has shown that coronaviruses usually have an ability to rapidly mutate. 9 We cannot exclude the possibility that some 2019-nCoVs will mutate to become "super-spreaders", as seen in SARS. Frequent disinfection of people-intensive places and animal trading markets should help stop the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, the outbreak has cast a shadow over the celebrations for the Lunar New Year, which falls on January 25. Millions of people in China travel over the course of the Spring Festival, both within the country and overseas. In addition, millions of college students (Wuhan has more than 1 million college students) will return to school after the winter vacation. This large-scale population migration could lead to further spread of this virus. Therefore, it is possible that this epidemic will be more serious after the Spring Festival. At present, the National Health Commission of China ( http://www.nhc.gov.cn ) has listed 2019-nCoV as Class B infectious disease and managed as Class A. Measures including the temperature monitoring of passengers at railway stations, airports, terminals and other transportation hubs have been carried out, which should slow the spread of the virus to a certain extent. However these disease control policies are far from enough, more strict methods to control population flow should be on the table.

The MHV-JHM strain of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus is much more neurovirulent than the MHV-A59 strain, although both strains use murine CEACAM1a (mCEACAM1a) as the receptor to infect murine cells. We previously showed that Ceacam1a(-/-) mice are completely resistant to MHV-A59 infection (E. Hemmila et al., J. Virol. 78:10156-10165, 2004). In vitro, MHV-JHM, but not MHV-A59, can spread from infected murine cells to cells that lack mCEACAM1a, a phenomenon called receptor-independent spread. To determine whether MHV-JHM could infect and spread in the brain independent of mCEACAM1a, we inoculated Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. Although Ceacam1a(-/-) mice were completely resistant to i.c. inoculation with 10(6) PFU of recombinant wild-type MHV-A59 (RA59) virus, these mice were killed by recombinant MHV-JHM (RJHM) and a chimeric virus containing the spike of MHV-JHM in the MHV-A59 genome (SJHM/RA59). Immunohistochemistry showed that RJHM and SJHM/RA59 infected all neural cell types and induced severe microgliosis in both Ceacam1a(-/-) and wild-type mice. For RJHM, the 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) is <10(1.3) in wild-type mice and 10(3.1) in Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. For SJHM/RA59, the LD(50) is <10(1.3) in wild-type mice and 10(3.6) in Ceacam1a(-/-) mice. This study shows that infection and spread of MHV-JHM in the brain are dependent upon the viral spike glycoprotein. RJHM can initiate infection in the brains of Ceacam1a(-/-) mice, but expression of mCEACAM1a increases susceptibility to infection. The spread of infection in the brain is mCEACAM1a independent. Thus, the ability of the MHV-JHM spike to mediate mCEACAM1a-independent spread in the brain is likely an important factor in the severe neurovirulence of MHV-JHM in wild-type mice.

Tetanus is acquired via environmental exposure to the spores of Clostridium tetani,which are present in soil worldwide. The disease is caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by the bacterium in dead tissue, e.g.,dirty wounds. Diphtheria is a bacterial disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriac and is transmitted from person to person through close physical contact. The public health burden ofboth diseaseshas been low in developed countries due to routine immunization. However, outbreaks ofdiphtheria have been reported in the independent states ofthe former Soviet Union, Algeria, China, Iraq, Sudan, Thailand and other countries. Thus, maintaining high vaccination coverage is important to prevent the outbreak of new diphtheria epidemics. Although vaccines that prevent from tetanus and diphtheria have been used for routine immunization for a long time all over the world, few studies exist that document their efficacyin elderly people. The vaccination coverage among elderly subjects is decreasing in several European countries and up to 40% of appropriately vaccinated elderly persons do not have protective tetanus-specific antibody concentrations. 47-49Therefore, public health authorities ofsome European countries have recommended five instead often year booster vaccination intervals for people over 60 years ofage. Additionally, strategies should be developed to draw public attention to the problem ofimmunizations in the elderly, to inform general practitioners and to increase vaccination acceptance.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a zoonotic viral disease that can be transmitted from dromedaries to human beings. More than 1500 cases of MERS have been reported in human beings to date. Although MERS has been associated with 30% case fatality in human beings, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in dromedaries is usually asymptomatic. In rare cases, dromedaries may develop mild respiratory signs. No MERS-CoV or antibodies against the virus have been detected in camelids other than dromedaries. MERS-CoV is mainly acquired in dromedaries when they are less than 1 year of age, and the proportion of seropositivity increases with age to a seroprevalence of 100% in adult dromedaries. Laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries can be achieved through virus isolation using Vero cells, RNA detection by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and antigen detection using respiratory specimens or serum. Rapid nucleocapsid antigen detection using a lateral flow platform allows efficient screening of dromedaries carrying MERS-CoV. In addition to MERS-CoV, which is a lineage C virus in the Betacoronavirus (betaCoV) genus, a lineage B betaCoV and a virus in the Alphacoronavirus (alphaCoV) genus have been detected in dromedaries. Dromedary CoV UAE-HKU23 is closely related to human CoV OC43, whereas the alphaCoV has not been detected in human beings to date.

More 'new' CoVs are likely to be generated due to the high recombination rate in this group of viruses.

Herein, we developed a multiplexed helicase assay based on graphene oxide (GO) for high-throughput screening of inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) helicase. Previously, we reported a GO-based helicase assay (GOHA), which relied on the preferential binding of ssDNA over dsDNA to the GO surface and subsequent quenching of the fluorescently labeled ssDNA by energy transfer from the dyes to the GO, and we validated the assay using SARS CoV helicase. [10] Herein, we show that the GOHA can be used for measuring the activities of HCV NS3 helicase and SARS CoV helicase in a single mixed solution using two distinct DNA substrates tethered to different fluorophores, and furthermore, for multiplexed high-throughput screening to discover highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of these helicases ( Figure 1 ). One round of screening the chemical library using the multiplexed GOHA (mGOHA) revealed three classes of inhibitors-specific inhibitors of HCV NS3 helicase, specific inhibitors of SARS CoV helicase, and general inhibitors of both helicases. To date, GO has been used to develop various biosensors and enzyme assays, [10, 11] but concerns about the heterogeneity of the chemical structure and the physical dimensions of GO and nonspecific binding of biomolecules to GO hamper the application of GO-based assays in high-throughput parallel assays for drug discovery that require high robustness and reproducibility. Herein, we show that GO can be used for the discovery of potent smallmolecule drug candidates and also determine the specificity and relative effectiveness towards each helicase of each of the identified hits.

The causative agent of COVID-19 is a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [2] . This belongs to a family of viruses that are found in humans and different species of animals including cattle, camels and bats. These have in the past caused serious disease outbreaks in human populations as happened in MERS (caused by MERS-CoV) and SARS (caused by SARS-CoV) [1, 4, 5] , it has been reported that both these viruses like SARS-CoV-2 have their origins in bats. The virus is mainly spread from person to person, through respiratory droplets, the spread is more likely when people are within 6 feet of each other [1] . Symptoms of the disease may appear 2-14 days after exposure and may include fever, cough shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain and loss of taste or smell [2, 6] . Many of these are common with influenza, however high persistent fever, dry cough and difficulty in breathing [6] seem to characterize COVID-19. The symptoms may range from very mild (in 80 % of the cases) to severe (in 15 % of the cases) to critical (in 5 % of the cases) [2] . Those at higher risk for severe illness include the elderly (people ages 65 and above) and people with underlying medical conditions which may include chronic lung diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney diseases, serious heart conditions and immunocompromised individuals [14] . At this time there is no available vaccine for COVID-19, and the available antiviral treatments are all in the trial phase [1] . This prompted health authorities to stress upon social distancing as a means to control the spread of the disease [2] . Lock downs were enforced in various countries, however these measures have resulted in substantial economic and social cost [7] . As a consequence many countries have started to ease the lock downs, despite concerns expressed by public health practitioners. There may be some positive news as in some recent studies antiviral treatments have shown some promising results, reducing the infectious period and alleviating disease symptoms [9, 8, 12, 13] . As the disease burden of COVID-19 continues to rise steeply, there is a rush to verify the benefits of different treatment regimens for which there is any anecdotal evidence available. Initial clinical trials so far have produced mixed results with some drug regimens showing encouraging outcomes, such as shortening of the duration of the disease, while others showing no significant change in the outcomes due to medication. The anti malarial hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as possible medication for COVID-19. While the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States has began clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine taken together with azithromycin [15], a recent study by Mehra et.al [10] has been unable to confirm any benefit of hydroxychloroquine when used alone or with a macrolide (such as Azithromycin), on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19, in fact, each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival. Another drug that has been suggested to have beneficial effects in COVID-19 treatment is Remdesivir. Some initial studies on the effectiveness of Remdesivir have been published; Wang et.al [11] reported no significant clinical improvement in COVID-19 symptoms using the drug, they do recommend further clinical studies be done, however Grein et.al [13] have reported improvement in 68% of the patients in a controlled trial using the drug, similarly Beigel et.al [9] have also reported shortening in the time to recovery with Remdesivir use. Huang et.al [6] used a triple anti viral therapy in their study and have reported alleviation of symptoms and shortening the duration of the disease. At the time of writing several studies are being carried out for a variety of plausible treatments which have shown some positive results. Based on this one can be cautiously optimistic about the possibility that medication that alleviates symptoms and shortens the duration of the disease may be available soon. Since the outbreak many mathematical models have been proposed to estimate the growth rates and understand the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. These include phenomenological models [16, 17] , stochastic models [18] , both of which are very useful in the early stages of the outbreak, and mechanistic models [19, 20, 22, 23, 30] that incorporate our understanding of the transmission pathways. Imran et.al [24] and Perkins et.al [31] have used optimal control techniques to propose efficient control strategies. The aim of such modeling is twofold, one to provide estimates of the severity of the outbreak by calculating quantities like the growth trends of the epidemic, estimates of the final outbreak size and duration of the outbreak and second to provide insights into efficacy of various control measures. In the literature a variety of mathematical models have been proposed to study the role of medication in controlling different epidemics. Lee et.al [25] consider an extension of the SEIR model with isolation and treatment to study various treatment and isolation strategies for controlling an influenza pandemic. Granich et.al [27] use an SIR model with multiple infection and treatment stages to study the effects of antiretroviral therapy and universal voluntary reporting for HIV. Jia et.al [26] study the effectiveness of various control strategies including treatment using an SEIR model with compartments for acute and chronic stages of infection and treatment. Sharomi et.al [28] use an extension for the SEIR model to study HIV/TB co-infection and do a cost/benefit analysis of various treatment strategies. Tufail et.al [29] study a model for the transmission ad control of the H1N1 Influenza (Swine Flu) using an extended SEIR model with treatment, vaccination and hospitalization compartments. This study is motivated by some promising reports about the success of various drug therapies in medical trials as discussed above. We are interested in studying the effects of medication on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and in particular the effects on quarantine and other control strategies. We extend an earlier model by Imran et.al [24] to model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The model incorporates asymptomatic, isolation and quarantine compartments, these are considered particularly relevant in the transmission of COVID-19, we also include a compartment representing the medicated population group. We establish a threshold quantity, the basic reproductive number R0, the disease dies out if R0 < 1 and is endemic in the population when R0 > 1. We calculate the sensitivity of R0 on various model parameters, identifying the contact rate, the rates of entering and leaving the quarantine and the rate and efficacy of the medication,as parameters to which R0 is most sensitive. We also study the variation in R0 as the quarantine rate and the rate and the efficacy of the medication is varied, leading to some interesting observations. Using techniques from optimal control theory, we propose efficient quarantine, isolation and medication strategies. We also compare the quarantine and isolation strategies with and without the availability of medication, which leads to some insights regarding easing of lock downs once medication is available. Finally, we estimate R0 for different countries, which are at different phases of the epidemic. In India and Pakistan the epidemic is still in the growth phase, the dynamics of the disease also seem to be different here than in Europe and North America, with a much slower growth and mortality rate. We also fit the our model to the outbreak data to estimate the proportion of asymptomatics in the population and the average quarantine rate in these countries.

RESULTS: There are 33 COVID-19 patients (16 male, 17 female), and the median age was 46 years. Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak. Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)]. Most patients' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first major outbreak of a newly emergent communicable disease in the 21st century, affecting over 8000 persons on multiple continents. 1 Its appearance stirred an unprecedented coordinated effort to control transmission and morbidity, motivated by fears that local outbreaks might give rise to a major pandemic within months. From the onset, mathematical modeling has proven to be a very useful tool for evaluating the impact of the control measures instigated. [2] [3] [4] The SARS outbreak originated in the Guangdong province of China, from where it spread to Hong Kong and next to Vietnam, Singapore and Canada. On 15 March 2003 , the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a second global alert together with a name for the new disease and a case definition. 1 The outbreak was fully contained by July 2003, the last case occurring in Canada. SARS coronavirus, the causative agent of the new disease, 5,6 most likely was transmitted to humans by the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata). 7 Adaptation to human transmission is possible through a single mutation in the spike glycoprotein of a civet SARS-like virus. 8, 9 As SARS-like viruses continue to circulate in animal reservoirs, 10,11 the risk of another major outbreak remains.
